            	<p>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe (MK vs. DC) is a crossover fighting game from Midway Games (in its last project before being bankrupt and sold the rights[4]), and Warner Bros. Games (in its project debut and unrestricted ESRB rating with DC Comics). The game was released on November 16, 2008 and contains both franchise characters. Its story was written by comic writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray.
<br /><br />
The game takes place after Raiden, Earthrealm's god of Thunder, and Superman, protector of Earth, repel invasions from both their worlds. An attack by both Raiden and Superman simultaneously in their separate universes causes the merging of the Mortal Kombat and DC villains, Shao Kahn and Darkseid, resulting in the creation of Dark Kahn whose mere existence causes the merging of the universes that if continued would result in the destruction of both universes. Characters from both universes begin to have a flux in power, becoming stronger or weaker.
<br /><br />
MK vs. DC was developed using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 and is available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It is the first Mortal Kombat title developed solely for a seventh generation video game console. Most reviewers agreed that MK vs. DC was entertaining and made good use of its DCU license; however, a lack of unlockable features as opposed to past installments and toned down finishing moves garnered some criticism.</p>
				<br />
				<h4>The originally planned Mortal Kombat 8</h4>
                	<p>Before MK vs. DC was announced, Midway released several hints of what Mortal Kombat 8 would be like. It was said it would be available for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. Despite a Wii version not being announced, there was some requests and beliefs that there would be a Wii version. It turned out that the PC version was simply an error, and there is no PC version. Midway also announced that Mortal Kombat 8 would be more dark and scary, and would be like the graphics of Gears of War. Midway also announced that Mortal Kombat 8 would be where almost every original Mortal Kombat character dies, except a few survivors, and they would then make most of the new characters by scratch. It was also confirmed that Scorpion and Sub-Zero will be surviving characters. There was a long hiatus of Mortal Kombat 8 confirmations after this, and then it was announced that MK vs. DC was going to be made. It seems Mortal Kombat 8 ideas were completely scrapped, and MK vs. DC really isn't Mortal Kombat 8 but just a spin-off crossover. It has since been confirmed that the next game will be a re-telling of the first 3 games, and thus the previous ideas have been completely abandoned. The title is now known as simply "Mortal Kombat". The concept of original character death seems to have carried over as the majority of original characters in the new Mortal Kombat are killed, although these deaths were not permanent. </p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            	<img style="margin:0 0 0 10px" class="right" src="Imagini/MK vs DC Universe/mkvsdcuss.png" width="300" height="779" title="MK vs DC Universe screen shots" alt="no image loaded" />
                <iframe style="margin:0 10px 0 10px" class="right" width="380" height="275" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6MrwJlxd9oE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>It features a story mode, playable from two different perspectives. The perspectives consist of one segment from the DC Universe side, and one from the Mortal Kombat side, each split up into various chapters. Depending on which side players choose, the characters see characters from the opposite universe as the invaders of their own. Ed Boon, creative director of MK vs. DC and co-creator of the Mortal Kombat franchise, did confirm that the player would have the ability to play as all the characters in the story mode at one point during development, but the story mode instead had a few characters not having their own story arcs. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe also contains a mode called "Kombo Challenge". Its aspect is individual to the Versus and Story modes, where players must perform ten precreated combos of increasing difficulty.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>Unlike previous "Mortal Kombat" titles, which used a control scheme of four buttons of high and low punches and kicks, four buttons on the game controller represent attacks that correspond to each limb. The same control scheme is used in the follow-up game Mortal Kombat. Intertwined within fight matches, which are played in a 3D fighter style, are new gameplay modes, such as "Free-Fall Kombat" or "Falling Kombat," which is activated automatically after throwing the opponent to a lower level in the arena. The players can fight in the air during the fall in a quasi-mini-game, with a player having to hit certain buttons to be on top during the fall and deal out the damage when the fall ends. "Klose Kombat" is a mode the players can enter during a fight, causing the characters to lock with each other and the perspective to change to a close-up shot of the two, to make for an interval of close-quarters fighting. A "Test Your Might" mini-game is also worked into the gameplay. While fighting in certain areas, the player can smash the opponent through a series of walls and engage in a tug-of-war with the damage meter at the top of the screen. The player on the offense mashes buttons to increase damage, while the player on the defense mashes buttons to decrease damage taken.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>Another in-fight feature called "Rage mode" is also a new aspect introduced in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. The Rage mode is governed by a rage meter placed below the player's health meter, that fills progressively every time the player receives damage or attacks. Once the meter is completely filled, Rage mode can be activated which lasts for several seconds. Rage mode causes the hits of the attacker to break the opponent's guard on the second hit; prevents the attacker from experiencing hit stun, knockdown or pop-up, and increases the damage of an attacker's moves. During fights, characters show permanent signs of visual damage, such as bruises, scrapes, bleeding, and broken or torn clothing. All of the characters except Darkseid, Shao Kahn, and Dark Kahn have finishing moves; the Mortal Kombat characters and the DC villains can execute Fatalities, while the DC heroes can execute moves called "heroic brutalities," which function in the same manner but do not kill opponents, in order to stay in tone with the heroes who have an established reputation of never taking a life.</p>

            <h2>Storyline</h2>
            	<iframe style="margin:0 0 0 10px" class="right" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Pp2Cvryq1Qo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>When a cataclysmic force merges conquerors from two universes conflict is inevitable. Kombat forces friends to fight, worlds to collide, and unlikely alliances to be forged. In order to save all they know, the heroes and villains of Mortal Kombat must wage war against the combined might of the DC Universe. How can either side prevail when Rage blinds them to the dark threat poised to destroy them all? Which side will you choose?</p>
            	<p>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe does not follow chronologically with the other games in the Mortal Kombat series, and is considered an "ultimate-Elseworlds" for DC Universe continuity by story co-writer Jimmy Palmiotti.
<br /><br />
After Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm is defeated by Raiden's forces of light, Raiden blasts and sends Kahn through a portal. At exactly the same time on Earth, Superman stops Darkseid's Apokoliptian invasion by blasting Darkseid with his heat vision as he enters a boom tube. These acts do not destroy either of them, but merges them into Dark Kahn, and causes the DC and Mortal Kombat universes to merge. At that rate, the characters' abilities fluctuate, causing violent "rage" outbreaks that are actually the feelings of Dark Kahn being fused into the characters from afar. Because of this, certain characters either gain strength or vulnerability. This allows things such as the possibility of Superman being defeated due to his vulnerability to magic, and giving the Joker the ability to fight Raiden. With each world thinking that the other is responsible for the merger, they fight each other in Mortal Kombat until only one fighter from each side remains: Raiden and Superman which in the final battle, they fight while Dark Kahn feeds on their rage. Both realizing that the other is not working with Dark Kahn, they overcome their rage for each other and defeat their fused enemy, restoring the two worlds to their normal separation. While everyone else has been sent to their original universe, Darkseid and Shao Kahn have been switched and are both rendered powerless. In the end, they both face eternal imprisonment in the other's universe; Darkseid is restrained in the Netherealm, while Shao Kahn is trapped in the Phantom Zone</p>

            <h2>Characters</h2>
            	<p>According to interviews, the characters were chosen for their popularity, and for parallels between them from both universes. Boon has said that some of the characters' abilities, especially those from the DC Universe, had been toned down to make them balanced within MK vs. DC. For example, Boon specifically mentioned that Superman became vulnerable because of magic. Boon revealed on the morning of July 7, 2009, via Twitter that two new characters were developed as downloadable content, Quan Chi from Mortal Kombat and Harley Quinn from DC comics but had been discarded. He had also earlier hinted at the prospect of Cyrax, Killer Croc, Nightwing, Reptile, Kung Lao, and Doomsday being downloadable characters.</p>
