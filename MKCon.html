                	<p>"In each of us there burns a soul of a warrior. In every generation a few are chosen to prove it. Centuries ago, in a time of darkness and fury, that fate befell three strangers. A monk, Kung Lao; an exiled guard, Siro; and a thief, Taja, who have to defend our realm from the forces of Outworld. By fighting for their lives, by fighting for their honor and by fighting for their realm...in a tournament called Mortal Kombat."</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Many centuries ago, Earth was an enchanting and desirable planet. Powerful and rich with natural resources, the vicious megalomaniac Shao Kahn wanted Earth as part of his growing collection of conquered realms known as Outworld. To protect Earth, Mortal Kombat, a tournament in which the fate of the planet is decided in battles between competitors from Earthrealm and Outworld, was created. Five hundred years in the past, the monk warrior Kung Lao defeated Shao Kahn's sorcerer, Shang Tsung. When Kung Lao spared his life, Kahn imprisoned Tsung in the cobalt mines.
<br /><br />
Kung Lao now had to train the next generation of warriors, who would give their lives to save Earth. Kung Lao creates a partnership and friendship with two warriors: Siro, a former bodyguard, and Taja, an ex-thief. In the mysterious city of Zhuzin, Kung Lao and his new friends are guided and watched over by the thunder god Raiden. The three now battle various evils of both Outworld and Earthrealm, including an imprisoned Tsung, who swore eternal revenge on Kung Lao for his humiliating defeat, and the sultry and seductive Vorpax, who is also imprisoned in the mines and has an agenda of her own.</p>

At first, Kung Lao's friends don't believe him when he presents the evidence, but they later discover that the Shaakans are being lied to by Shao Kahn's so-called "disciples", particularly his Shadow Priests, into thinking they will be getting salvation in "Far-land" (really Outworld). However, the people are so naive and careless that they refuse to believe the truth. Dion is also revealed to be a traitor, aligning herself with Shao.

                <h4>Notable guest appearances</h4>
                	<p>With Konquest immediately following TNT's top-rated program, WCW Monday Nitro, WCW wrestlers Meng and Wrath filmed separate appearances. Former QVC model Dorian played the barmaid Magda in the episodes "Twisted Truth" and "Quan Chi." Eva Mendes, who would go on to become a highly successful actress and model, also appeared in one episode as Siro's ex-girlfriend.</p>
                    <br />
                <h4>Production and distribution</h4>
                	<p>Mortal Kombat: Konquest was produced by Threshold Entertainment (who produced the Mortal Kombat film series) in association with New Line Television (television arm of the films' distributor). Warner Bros. Television Distribution (the Warner Bros. unit (eventual holder of the Mortal Kombat property)[3] is New Line's corporate sibling turned parent) syndicated the series until it was later picked up by TNT, who aired the remaining new episodes in addition to broadcasting repeats in syndication. With a lucrative timeslot following WCW Monday Nitro, Konquest was very popular, but according to the show's developer, Joshua Wexler, this resulted in higher budget costs for the show than anticipated. The cancellation was not announced at first, and rumors of a second season circulated. However, TNT pulled the plug on the show, leaving it with a cliffhanger ending. The ending was planned to have been resolved in the second season, which would have summed up the series and corresponded with the MK timeline.</p>                <h4>DVD</h4>
                    <p>Mortal Kombat: Konquest has not been released on DVD in North America, but is currently available in the United Kingdom and Australia, where it enjoyed a more successful run on television. The complete and fully licensed DVD collection is currently available only in Australia. Unofficial collections produced in the UK consist of unrelated and edited episodes merged so that each disc contains a theme, and some of the DVDs contain spelling errors on the covers. Several episodes of the series, consisting of one show per disc, were released in Germany; two of the discs feature episodes centered around Kreeya and Sub-Zero. DVDs were also recently released in Portugal, with many spelling errors on the covers.</p>
