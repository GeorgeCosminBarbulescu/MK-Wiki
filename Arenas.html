            <h2>Arenas:</h2>
            	<p>(source http://mortalkombat.wikia.com)</p>
            	<h4>Recurring arenas</h4>
            	<h4>Armory:</h4>
                	<p>The Armory is a stage that made its debut in Mortal Kombat II. This is where the Outworld weapons are crafted; there is molten metal in the background that would have been used to make them. A Mortal Kombat symbol hangs in the center room. The Armory that is also part of Shao Kahn's Fortress debuted in Mortal Kombat II and subsequently appeared in Mortal Kombat Trilogy, Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition, and Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, the Armory serves as the final stage as well as part of the Foundry in the game, leading to Shao Kahn's Arena. Fiery pits of molten metal abound all over the place and one must craft an axe by solving puzzles in order to shatter the crystals which lock the gateway leading to Kahn's Arena. The stage also houses an elusive secret called Survival Mode in which the player must survive the 9 stages against most of the bosses in the game in several locations.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>An updated version of this arena is featured in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. This version of the Armory retains the molten metal in the background, which a player can now be knocked into as a death trap, but now also features a giant rolling rock crusher on a conveyor belt, which is used to smash ore to be melted down for weapons-making, or any player that is knocked onto it.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Armageddon's Konquest mode, Taven is exploring Shao Kahn's Fortress and is confronted by Mileena in the fortress' dungeons. He soon fought her in the Armory before continuing, moving forward in search of the sorcerer Quan Chi, who attacked Taven's dear friend Orin.</p>
                    <p>The Armory returns in Mortal Kombat (2011). The Mortal Kombat Logo in the background is seen being lowered and taken out of a forge repeatedly during matches. One of the executioners is also seen forging a sword in the background.</p>
                    <br />

                    <hr style="border:1px dotted #CCCCCC" />
                    <h4>Balcony:</h4>
                	<p>The first Balcony which is located at Shao Kahn's Fortress, is a place of kombat during the Konquerer's invasion of Earthrealm. it has two Centaurian statues on both sides of the room. A hole shows a green light where the Soul Chamber rests below. It also served as Motaro's sanctuary, it even sometimes referred to as Motaro's Balcony or Motaro's Lair.
<br /><br />
The Balcony debuted in Mortal Kombat 3 and its remakes. (For unknown reasons, it was errornously referred to as "Kahn's Tower" in the arcade version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.) It served as the arena wherein the player battled sub-boss Motaro (though in the SNES version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, the battle with Motaro takes place on The Roof, as The Balcony was removed in the port).
<br /><br />
It should be noted that Noob's Dorfen is an edit of the Balcony (no walls and Motaro's statue). </p>
                    <br />

                    <hr style="border:1px dotted #CCCCCC" />
                    <h4>Bell Tower:</h4>
                	<p>The Bell Tower is a stage in the Mortal Kombat series. It appears in Mortal Kombat 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat Trilogy, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, and Mortal Kombat (2011). In Mortal Kombat 3 and its updates, opponents can be uppercutted to a bed of spikes similar of that of The Pit. The spikes are located several floors down, in the basement, and the opponent will be sent through several floors before reaching the spikes.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, an opponent can be uppercutted into a spike with four sharp edges. As the opponent slowly comes down and ends up being impaled on the spikes and sharp edges cut their legs and arms, a small rat-like creature then appears and takes the left leg for use as food. In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, a death trap on the Bell Tower works only on the lower stage and only after "Finish Him/Finish Her" is said. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In the first version of Mortal Kombat 3, this arena was mistakenly referred to as the "Shao Kahn Tower." </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The Bell Tower appears in Mortal Kombat (2011), and rats and ravens are also visible. This version takes place during the day instead of the night. Other changes are that it appears to be a clock tower, as well as it being located between St. Dominic's Cemetery and Boon*Beran Station in a city within Earthrealm and is featured in the Story Mode of Mortal Kombat (2011) under the name Vogel University. Despite its clock tower appearance, the stage is still named the Bell Tower, as there are several bells located around the inner-workings of the tower. </p>
                    <br />
                    <h4><a class="custom" href="#home" title="" target="_self">Back to top</a></h4>
                    <br />
                    <hr style="border:1px dotted #CCCCCC" />
                    <h4>Courtyard:</h4>
                	<p>This is the courtyard of Shang Tsung’s Island Fortress in the Lost Sea. Great tournaments have been held here for centuries. Guards patrol and students watch warriors engage in Mortal Kombat. It is sometimes referred to as simply "The Courtyard" or "Shang Tsung's Courtyard".
<br /><br />
This arena first appeared in the first Mortal Kombat game. In it, an aged Shang Tsung sits on a throne and watches the Mortal Kombat tournament. Monk students also watch and applaud after every round is finished. This is reminiscent of the tournament courtyard from the movie set of Enter the Dragon. In Mortal Kombat Trilogy, when fighting in this arena, Shang Tsung has been replaced with Shao Kahn. It should be noted that the scepter that Kahn holds is not the same as the one in Kahn's Arena and Kahn's Kave. Also, the monks are no longer animated nor do they applaud after a round is over.
<br /><br />
A different version of this same arena was featured in Mortal Kombat: Deception. The kombatants now simply stand on a completely square shaped elevated platform. The monks are no longer in the front of the stage and has been removed to the sides of the stage. Shang Tsung is still sitting in his seat in his original appearance and watch as the fights commence.
<br /><br />
In Mortal Kombat (2011), there is a day and night version of Shang Tsung's Courtyard.
<br /><br />
An arena very similar to the Courtyard appears in the Mortal Kombat movie. It is seen during the fight between Liu Kang and the Fighting Monk, and the match between Sonya Blade and Kano, respectively. The movie's Courtyard also features a stone fighting area, an audience, and a throne upon which Shang Tsung sits and officiates. </p>

                    <h4>Dead Pool:</h4>
                	<p>The Dead Pool is an arena in the Mortal Kombat series. The Dead Pool debuted in Mortal Kombat II and later reappeared in several sequels.
<br /><br />
The Dead Pool is said to be a place for punishment and sacrifice. Captives would be bound with chains, then lowered into the acid below. Shang Tsung was said to have favored this method of punishment. The Dead Pool was a particular form of punishment sentenced to those condemned by Shao Kahn himself. The acid itself is a mass of residue of past creations from Shang Tsung's flesh pits. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat: Deception</b></p>
                    <p>A 3D version of the Dead Pool appeared in Mortal Kombat: Deception. Instead of a straight walkway across the acid, players fight on a square patch of concrete in the middle of the acid. Players who are close to the edge can be knocked into the acid to perform a deathtrap, where an "Oh, whoa" would be heard as tribute to the MKII secret. Shang Tsung watches over the arena from a balcony, dressed in his original MKII outfit. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks</b></p>
                    <p>The arena also appears in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. The Shaolin Monks first enter this area after escaping the Wastelands. When players approach this arena, they are ambushed by undead bloody skeletons. They must knock the skeletons onto the hooks hanging from the ceiling to pass. In the next room, one must use the swing ability to leave the Dead Pool. The Dead Pool can be unlocked as an arena in Versus mode. The versus mode variant of the stage has a T-shaped walkway with acid pools on both sides. The fighters can run around in the acid at the expense of health. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)</b></p>
                    <p>The Dead Pool appears in Mortal Kombat (2011). The arena is back to the single bridge that goes across the pool. The chains are now manually operated, handled by two executioners using a large reel. Prisoners are bound and suspended above the acid by the hooked chains where they are promptly dipped into the acidic pool after a few moments are then dragged back up with their flesh and skin disintegrated and torn as burnt corpses. In Mortal Kombat (2011), instead of falling into the acidic pool and coming back up as a skeleton, the victim will flail around in the pool as the acid dissolves their flesh and leaves behind a face down skeletal frame.</p>
                    <br /><br />
                    <p><b>Soundtrack</b></p>
                    <p>The soundtrack "The Dead Pool" was released in the album Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack. It was composed by the Midway sound programmer Dan Forden. The song is still the same in Deception except it is an extended version. </p>
                    <br /><br />
                    <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>In MK II, holding the down button during the Stage Fatality will make the voice of Dan Forden say "Foul Ball". The soundbite plays automatically in the deathtrap of Deception. There were a few rumors concerning the Dead Pool, which mainly involved the chains hanging from the ceiling. One such was that it was possible to knock an opponent into the hooked ends, and that such chains acted as a mechanism to unlock something if body weight was applied to them. This rumor was included in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks.
Unused sprites from the arcade version of Mortal Kombat II show that originally, the Dead Pool was to have an orange sky background behind the windows, much like the Portal and Kombat Tomb. In the SNES version of Mortal Kombat II, as well as the N64 version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy, the orange sky is present.
In Mortal Kombat Trilogy, the Shao Kahn Treasures that involve fighting somebody (i.e. Chameleon) are fought in the Dead Pool stage.
In MK (2011), ghostly screams can be faintly heard, moreso if the music volumem is turned down low enough. </p>

                    <h4>Falling Cliff:</h4>
                	<p>The Falling Cliffs is a hostile, mountainous area in Outworld. Plagued with constant tremors and earthquakes, this volcanic region is very dangerous. Sulfur pours out of cracks and holes. Mountains blow smoke like giant chimneys. This area was first seen in Mortal Kombat: Deception, and returned in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon as an unlockable stage.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>A small rounded arena of dirt and rocks, there are a few double-barred cross-like polls on the outside rim with dead bodies of unfortunate individuals who are being crucified on them, and with a view of mountains in the background. As a fight continues, the arena becomes smaller and smaller as the outer levels fall away. Players caught on the ledge when this happens will find themselves impaled by the spikes at the bottom of the canyon. In the event that both players fall and are impaled, the player with the least damage taken during the match will win. If however both players fall and are impaled when they have a health bar of 100%, player one is always the winner.
<br /><br />
In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, the arena returns, but no big changes have been made.
<br /><br />
The background music is very suitable for the Arena. </p>

                	<p>The Fire Well is an arena that appears to be surrounded by fire and its walls are decorated with the skeletal remains of defeated warriors, the skulls of some fighters even litter the floor, and hellfire burns endlessly and deeply behind the arena's grates. This arena made its debut in Mortal Kombat 4 and Mortal Kombat Gold. The arena has returned in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon with an updated version of itself. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The skulls that litter the ground can also be used as throwing weapons against your opponent. There appears to be only one entrance from a dark hallway. The Fire Well might be part of the hoary Netherrealm, as hellfire burns endlessly and deeply behind the grates, and the fallen Elder God Shinnok awaits challengers to add to his collection of mutilated bodies. It is where the heroes of Mortal Kombat battled with him in order to save the realms.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>A different and also updated version of the same Mortal Kombat 4 arena in which the defenders of Earthrealm did battle with the evil Elder God Shinnok was featured in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. On its bottom level, a conveyor belt which players can utilize as a death trap, operates on each wall, with a large wheel at their ends crushing blocks of stone. Should a kombatant lose sense of their footing and be knocked onto the belt, their life would soon end as their bones are ground into powder. </p>

                	<p>Goro's Lair is a stage that made its debut in Mortal Kombat. This lair is home to the Grand Champion Goro, where he battles in the first Mortal Kombat game. Shang Tsung also watches Goro's battles, for should he fail, Shang Tsung will intervene and battle as soon as Goro is defeated. Sometimes there will be boulders lying around. Spikes were later implemented on the lair's ceiling.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat</b></p>
                    <p>During 1-player games in the first Mortal Kombat, this stage doesn't appear until the last three battles are reached - the third Endurance match, and the boss battles (against Goro and Shang Tsung). All fights after the third and final "Test Your Might" bonus round take place here. Goro's Lair also appears randomly during the attract mode for demo fights, and is used between the Throne Room and the Courtyard in 2-player mode. </p>

                    <p>In the Nintendo 64 version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy, the Armory is located above Goro's Lair, and players can uppercut opponents there and from there to the Kombat Tomb. Strangely, Goro's Lair is known to be located in Earthrealm, whereas both The Tomb and Armory are in Outworld. The possibility exists that the Lair is linked to the Armory in Outworld via a portal, similar to how Scorpion's Lair in Netherrealm leads to Kahn's Kave, although a reasonable explanation is that it is because of the merging of the realms that is happening during that game. </p>

                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks</b></p>
                    <p>Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks reveals that Goro's Lair that became a walkthrough area, is actually made up of several rooms and dungeons, and it houses vicious Oni. The lair is even shown with a statue of Goro and a caged door leading directly into his lair. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</b></p>
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, Goro's Lair is a multi-tiered arena. Players can knock their opponent either upwards into another chamber, or through the various surrounding gates. The chamber the player ends up in is nearly identical to the primary chamber, but with less wall decoration (while maintaining an infinite number of cells a player can be knocked through). </p>

                    <p>In Mortal Kombat (2011), Goro's Lair is grittier and more detailed than before. This time around, the Shokan prince is sitting in his own throne watching in amusement who will win to have the right to advance towards him in the finals of the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament, also roaring after an uppercut, also occupying his lair is the very dim entering of light of the world above him and the dead or near dead chained bodies of occupants on the walls (possibly there to watch).

                    <p><br />Trivia:</p></p>
                	<p>In Mortal Kombat Trilogy, this arena was used for the opening story.
    In MKII, it appears when players fight the secret characters Jade, Smoke and Noob Saibot.
    Appearing in Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat Trilogy, Mortal Kombat 4, Mortal Kombat Gold, Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, and Mortal Kombat (2011) it is the most recurring arena in the series. Goro's Lair is tied with the Living Forest for having appeared in more Mortal Kombat games than any other arena.
    Goro's Lair arena theme from MK (arcade version) was also used for MK4 Goro's lair (PC, N64, PSX, etc.) the only possible difference with this, is the fact that MK4 Goro's theme is now an arranged theme of the original music.
    In the original Mortal Kombat (arcade version), 2-player and demonstration fights staged in Goro's Lair are set to the music from the Warrior Shrine, while the final battle against Shang Tsung is set to the Throne Room's music. In the attract mode, Goro's theme is used exclusively for Goro's bio.
    In Mortal Kombat (2011), if the player can manage to reach Shang Tsung without having lost a single round, win the fight with a Double Flawless Victory, and perform a Fatality on Shang Tsung in his elder form, the player will fight Classic Jade.
    Goro's lair on MK2011 appears to be below the courtyard. The story shows this and if you play on the courtyard stage. There is a shokan badge in the center of the ground. Meaning the lair is below this stage.
    In Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat Trilogy, the evil yellow eyes in the background were removed. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, the Armory serves as the final stage as well as part of the Foundry in the game, leading to Shao Kahn's Arena. Fiery pits of molten metal abound all over the place and one must craft an axe by solving puzzles in order to shatter the crystals which lock the gateway leading to Kahn's Arena. The stage also houses an elusive secret called Survival Mode in which the player must survive the 9 stages against most of the bosses in the game in several locations.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>An updated version of this arena is featured in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. This version of the Armory retains the molten metal in the background, which a player can now be knocked into as a death trap, but now also features a giant rolling rock crusher on a conveyor belt, which is used to smash ore to be melted down for weapons-making, or any player that is knocked onto it.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Armageddon's Konquest mode, Taven is exploring Shao Kahn's Fortress and is confronted by Mileena in the fortress' dungeons. He soon fought her in the Armory before continuing, moving forward in search of the sorcerer Quan Chi, who attacked Taven's dear friend Orin.</p>
                    <p>The Armory returns in Mortal Kombat (2011). The Mortal Kombat Logo in the background is seen being lowered and taken out of a forge repeatedly during matches. One of the executioners is also seen forging a sword in the background.</p>

                    <h4>Graveyard:</h4>
                	<p>The Graveyard, also referred to as Cemetery, is an arena consisting of a massive graveyard, that made it's first appearance in Mortal Kombat 3.
<br /><br />
The Graveyard features a full moon and on some of the headstones, players can see some of the games' design team names, such as Ed Boon and John Tobias. The supposed date of death on the tombstones is the date on which Mortal Kombat 3 was released in arcades. In the Nintendo 64 version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy, the stage has more random names on the gravestones near the front. As well as the original Midway design team of MK3, names of the team at Williams Entertainment were added. The date of death on the stones was changed, from April 1, 1995 to September 30, 1996, MK Trilogy's release date.
<br /><br />
The Graveyard was also seen in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. This new version allows players to be flung into markers and other decorations to facilitate combos, or sent down to a lower level via Free Fall Kombat.
<br /><br />
The Graveyard itself makes a reappearence in Mortal Kombat (2011), this time with the Soulnado in the background. The arena takes place at the end of the day as opposed to night. In MK 2011´s Story Mode the Graveyard is also featured as a location in Earthrealm under the name St. Dominic's Cemetery. </p>
<br />
                    <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>There is a tombstone reading "CAGE" on the left corner of the original stage, confirming that Johnny Cage did in fact die during Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm, by the hands of his extermination squads. It is probable that his grave and burial were made by his fellow Earth warriors in his honor. His tombstone reappears in the Graveyard stage of MK vs DCU on the lower level.
    Also in the MK 2011 iteration are headstones that read Omnia mors aequat, which is Latin for "Death equals all things." Other tombstones read Omnes vulnerant, ultima necat, Latin for "They all wound, and the last one kills," a phrase frequently found on Medieval clocks to remind people that their lives grow shorter with every second.
    The Graveyard is the only Mortal Kombat 3 arena that does not make it to the home console or handheld ports of the game, except for the Playstation version.
    On MK2011. The Bell Tower can be seen from the graveyard scene. Atleast the clock face can be seen. It's infront of most of the buildings in the distance. </p>

                    <h4>Hell:</h4>
                	<p>Hell (also once known as Scorpion's Lair and Hades in the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis ports of UMK3) is Scorpion's original battlefield and a stage in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. It debuted in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. In here, as a Stage Fatality an opponent can be uppercutted into a pool of lava nearby. Hell has also had a heavy metal BGM in its every apperance.
<br /><br />
It was never clarified if Hell and the Netherrealm are one and the same, or if Hell is just a part of the dark realm. However, in the manuals of earlier games, it is often referred to as "Earth's Hell," further confusing the matter. But, in MK9's Story Mode, when Raiden said he was going to the Netherrealm, he ended up in Hell, where Scorpion was. Additionally, Lucifer is said to have been the former ruler of the Netherrealm before being deposed by Shinnok. Assuming this Lucifer is equivalent to the Judeo-Christian devil, then Hell and the Netherrealm may be one and the same.
<br /><br />
The same diabolical arena reappeared in Mortal Kombat Armageddon. Resembling some parts of Scorpion's Lair, this arena is still situated in the hoary Netherrealm. Surrounded by boiling lava, skull pillars and jagged structures, kombatants took part in ferocious battles here on multiple levels after each opponent gets knocked out and then thrown down into the next level of the Netherrealm.
<br /><br />
Hell returns in Mortal Kombat (2011), with a darker, updated look from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. The changes made in the arena is that there are less skull pillars, there is smoke and a hell beast in the background, the skulls glow with sparks and lava and there are lit skulls on the ground. There are hands coming out of the small pits of lava. This arena can also be seen in Scorpion's Victory pose in the game. In the Mortal Kombat 2011 version of Hell, a Stage Fatality can be achieved forcing the victim's head into lava, burning the unfortunate soul's face off with their eye sockets leaking molten rock, trying to scream, but obviously cannot. Then the victim's opponent steps on the victim's head, dipping it even deeper in the lava. Finally, the victim's whole head is melted. </p>
<br />
					<p><b>Film and TV appearances</b></p>
                    <p>Scorpion's Lair was featured in the first Mortal Kombat film. After fighting Johnny Cage in a forest on Shang Tsung's island, Scorpion teleports both Cage and himself to an unspecified location, "welcoming" Cage on arrival, before continuing the fight. Cage manages to overcome Scorpion through the use of medieval weaponry, and escapes the dark place with his life. The arena is lit red and contains seemingly endless, randomly arranged networks of wooden bridges and scaffolds, along with the skeletons and weaponry of dead warriors.
<br /><br />
In the animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, Scorpion got a new teleporter who he must be sent to Hell. In Hell, he saw few ghosts and they catch into Scorpion's body. Shang Tsung remembers being sent to Hell (Netherrealm) and endured eternal torment among the damned within the dark and fiery void after he was defeated and killed by Liu Kang.
<br /><br />
In the TV series Mortal Kombat: Conquest, the same location is shown using stock footage from the 1995 movie along with new footage. It is here that Scorpion recruits fighters for his organization and it is implied that after his defeat in the episode "Warrior Eternal", Scorpion 'fell' through the Earth to this dark place. </p>

                    <p>Onaga's army became busy within the Foundry to create weapons and armor for future battles. Conveyor belts were used along with automated cauldrons to pour hot liquid steel while giant forging dies pound repeatedly, which makes the Foundry appear quite active. Distant factories were known to populate the horizon.
<br /><br />
In Hell’s Foundry, giant dies begin to shape newly cast slabs of metal, and crush any kombatant foolish enough to stray near. They will be used to make the instruments of war needed to defend the Dragon King’s reign as the ruler of Outworld. </p>

<br /><br />
This arena is also known as "Smoke's Portal", since it is accessed when fighting against Smoke via Kombat Kode in the first version of Mortal Kombat 3 (only if the Ultimate Kombat Kode has not yet been entered). Its only later appearance was in the Nintendo 64 version of MK Trilogy. It is also part of the Portal arena in Mortal Kombat: Deception.

Kahn's Arena also reappeared in Mortal Kombat Trilogy, however due to Sonya and Kano being playable they were removed from chains in the background.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks</b></p>
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, Kahn's Arena from MKII serves as the arena for the final battles of the game against Shang Tsung, Kintaro and Shao Kahn. The arena is depicted slightly differently; the arena is no longer a walkway, but an elevated circular platform. Although Kano and Sonya would be in chains to watch the battle, this can be altered if the player fights Kano in a secret boss fight. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)</b></p>
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat (2011), Kahn's arena was renamed to "Kahn's Coliseum" which is also sometimes called "Shao Kahn's Coliseum" or just "The Coliseum". Five characters were chained in the background of E3 demo - Kira, Li Mei, Tanya, Kitana and Skarlet. The emperor is now fully animated, mocking the fighters during the fight. In addition, this version is shown to have a dirt floor instead of a concrete linear pathway used for fighting, a much larger viewing audience for the width of the arena's spectacular and violent battles, a Tormentor fending off tamers in the background, and serves as the final stage of the retelling of Mortal Kombat II in this latest entry of the series, as well as the final stage in the arcade ladder.
<br /><br />
If Kitana and Skarlet are both used in Tag Ladder, Tanya will still be present taking Kitana's side, but no one will take Skarlet's place. Kira is however seen in the PlayStation Vita Version. </p>

                	<p>The Temple, also known as the Kombat Temple, The Church or The Cathedral, is a stage that made its debut in Mortal Kombat 3, and appeared again in a different form, known as The Church in Mortal Kombat Gold.
<br /><br />
Shao Kahn had a temple constructed for himself within his palace during his invasion of Earthrealm.
<br /><br />
This arena debuted in Mortal Kombat 3 and appeared in later installments as well such as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy. Though the arena was not featured in Mortal Kombat 4, it was later featured in the upgrade for Dreamcast, Mortal Kombat Gold, and renamed "The Church".
<br /><br />
The arena in Mortal Kombat 3 consists of lit red candles in the very front, stained glass embellished with the Mortal Kombat dragon in the back, lit skull torches, skull pillars and a fighting ground with Shao Kahn's head embellished in the center of the arena. </p>
					<br />
                    <p><b>The Church</b></p>
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat Gold, the arena called The Church', made its appearance as a darker, and more simplistic arena. The arena appeared with only one stained glass window in the back, and in front of the stained glass window lies a casket. This dark place houses numerous ancient tombs. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>The Cathedral</b></p>
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat (2011), a new 3D design of the Mortal Kombat 3 arena, now named The Cathedral, appears. In the background, Noob Saibot (sometimes), the Shadow Priests, Rain, and (what appears to be) Meat appear.
<br /><br />
In the MK 2011 Story Mode, the Temple serves as a meeting place for the Forces of Light during the Invasion of Earthrealm.
<br /><br />
Based on the trailers of MK 2011, Rain was originally going to appear in this stage's background, but was removed due to unknown reasons. </p>

                    <p>Mortal Kombat 3
<br />
    The music used for the Temple, Mortal Kombat 3 was once again used for the Church in Mortal Kombat Gold. 
<br /><br />
Mortal Kombat Gold
<br />
    In front of the stained glass window in Mortal Kombat Gold's version, lies a casket which you can see the bones of the corpse that lies within.

Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)
<br />
    Classic Noob occasionally appears instead of the Shadow Priests. If you manage to win the fight without using the block button, Classic Noob will challenge you.
    In Chapter 15 of the Story Mode, the Shadow Priests, Meat and the other cameos still appear in the background during fights, even though they are not there during cutscenes. </p>

                	<p>The Kombat Tomb is a stage in the Mortal Kombat series that appeared in Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat Trilogy.
<br /><br />
This arena features a stage fatality, where opponents can be uppercutted into a spiked ceiling at the top. If both players held down during the stage Fatality, then the corpse would fall to the ground, followed by a pained/worried "oooooooooh!". </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, the tomb appears only as part of the Soul Tombs' structures, where the sorcerer Shang Tsung regains his youth and powers. The place is ridden with corpses still attached to torture devices. It is only possible to reach the soul chamber by vivisecting the bodies beside it, thus unlocking the mechanism to open the door. The Kombat Tomb itself house the familiar ceiling spikes, but it is also possible to throw an opponent through the walls to their deaths. Baraka appears as the boss for this stage.
<br /><br />
In Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the Kombat Tomb reappears as the extra tier of the Apokolips/Outworld merger arena, however, the ceiling has been torn off. </p>

                    <br />
                    <p>The throne room is decorated with the tall pillars called the Pillars of Ancient Heroes that is decorated and attached with statue heads of ancient great rulers of the Shokan race. Prince Goro ruled here as one of the most feared half human, half dragon Shokan warriors. After his apparent death, an elaborate funeral procession led his casket to the Circle of Judgement, a circular molten rock contained within the throne room itself. Statues of his ancestors looked on while the casket was lowered into the eternal river of lava. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Princess Kitana, representing the Royal Family of Edenia, attended and bid farewell to her old friend. Unbeknownest to Kitana, however, it was not Goro inside the casket but a disfigured Shokan warrior Goro had placed his royal seal upon to fool people into thinking he had died in battle. He had actually been saved from death by Shao Kahn himself after being left for dead from a sneak attack by Noob Saibot.
<br /><br />
This arena first appeared in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance and returned later in Mortal Kombat: Deception complete with a death trap that left victims burning alive in the molten lava surrounding the platform. </p>

                	<p>Jade's Desert is an arena in the Mortal Kombat series. It first appeared in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, and also appeared in Mortal Kombat Trilogy. In this arena, Cyrax appears in the background struggling to get out of the sand, as seen up close in Cyrax's ending in the original version of MK3, where it is stated that he was stuck in the desert when he didn't receive any missions from the Lin Kuei. This desert is owned by the Edenian warrior Jade herself, though it is almost unclear that this desert is part of Outworld. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat (2011), a new 3D design of the Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 arena (now called The Desert) appears. In the background, Cyrax can sometimes be seen, struggling in the sand on the left side of the stage. This Cyrax is identical to his original MK3 appearance. Also, a statue of Queen Sindel's head and hand lie in the background revealing that this desert was actually part of Jade's beautiful, ancient homeworld of Edenia. The sand on the ground is now dynamic, as it depresses as players are knocked down and walking. Moves like Sub-Zero's Ground Freeze and Shang Tsung's Ground Fireball are hidden from the sand as well. Despite being an old arena, Jade's Desert does not have a secret BGM when used at the Arena Select screen as the original arena shared music with the Rooftop and the Bell Tower. The Desert plays a pivotal role in the story, as it is revealed to be the Queen's burial ground.
<br /><br />
It has been rumored that the arena was the background during the fight between Liu Kang and Jade in the second movie, but it is still unclear. </p>

                	<p>The Lin Kuei Palace, also known as the Lin Kuei Temple, is located in the icy region of Arctika in Earthrealm.
<br /><br />
Sub-Zero needed a remote base of operations for his newly reformed Lin Kuei clan. After a long search, he found this mysterious and ancient temple abandoned and frozen in the arctic wilderness and immediately claimed it as the new home of the Lin Kuei clan. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, after Taven learned from a group of monks and their abbot that it was built to honor the "Lady of Flame," which is his mother Delia, he enters the long forgotten temple and fights various Lin Kuei warriors. After entering a room, he finds an ice coffin and accidentally breaks it, awakening Frost, who was sealed inside the coffin. Frost quickly attacks Taven, but is defeated and she leaves the chamber.
<br /><br />
Taven continues, but is confronted by Sub-Zero. Before the outcome of the battle could be decided, Sub-Zero takes notice of the dragon tattoo he had on his face, commenting that it was similar to the one on the unopened vault door behind him. Taven, however, tries to open the door and succeeds. He acquires the armor his mother left for him. Sub-Zero comments that the second vault door had been opened long ago, before his new Lin Kuei had even arrived.
<br /><br />
Before Taven could make sense of this revelation and what it meant for his brother Daegon, the Lin Kuei Palace was invaded and attacked once again, only this time by an army of demonic ninjas, led by Noob Saibot and Smoke. The two fighters eventually team up as Taven and Sub-Zero defeat Noob Saibot and Smoke. After Noob's defeat, Sub-Zero tells Taven that Noob Saibot is actually his older brother, who was corrupted in the Netherrealm after his death. Sub-Zero also informs Taven about a mysterious clan known as the Red Dragon, whose location is in Charred Mountain.
<br /><br />
And the Lin Kuei Temple is one of the arenas in the racing minigame Motor Kombat, while the temple court and inner sanctums are arenas in Konquest mode. </p>

                    <h4>Living Forest:</h4>
                	<p>The Living Forest is located in Outworld. These woods of mystery have haunted inhabitants for centuries. The trees themselves are alive, some with faces that groan and roar. The faces sometimes move a lot or sometimes they may lie dormant for years. However, some of these faces appear to be hungry, and the unsuspecting traveler may find themselves ensnared in their treacherous branches, becoming prey as they are devoured. Then they become part of the forest, their agony-filled faces occupying a vacant tree or forming a new plantation altogether with their silhouette forever etched into the woods. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>MK Comics</b></p>
                    <p>In one of the MK comics, the forest is said to have once been a part of Edenia, where it was known as the Laughing Forest, as the trees were jolly and filled with mirth. This, however, is likely non-canon.
<br /><br />
The Living Forest is tied with Goro's Lair for having appeared in more Mortal Kombat games than any other arena. This stage premiered in Mortal Kombat II and then later in Mortal Kombat Trilogy. It is a playable arena in Mortal Kombat: Deception, and is also seen in Deception's Konquest mode. The Living Forest also appeared in the Mortal Kombat comic books as well. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat II</b></p>
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat II, Jade and Smoke could be seen lurking in the background, occasionally poking their heads from around the trees. A since-disproven rumor had the winning player performing a stage Fatality where one of the trees would chew up the opponent; this concept was integrated into the Shaolin Monks version as a means of progressing through the level. </p>
					<br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat 4</b></p>
                    <p>The arena is seen again in Mortal Kombat 4 and Mortal Kombat Gold; it is very similar to its previous incarnation, although Smoke and Jade are no longer hiding in the trees and it is now in 3D.</p>
					<br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat: Deception</b></p>
                    <p>The arena's Mortal Kombat: Deception appearance remained largely unaltered, aside from adding a ditch around the arena and crisper graphics. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks</b></p>
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, the Living Forest is both a Versus mode arena and an walkthrough area players can access through the single player/co-op modes. However, it looks significantly different than its MKII predecessor, sporting tombs and canopy walkways in the trees, and lit by many torches. </p>
					<br />
                    <p><b>Mortal Kombat (2011)</b></p>
                    <p>The Living Forest returns in Mortal Kombat (2011), this time with corpses laying around and hanging in the trees, and the faces on the trees now have a more skull-like appearance. This new living forest is home to a new Stage Fatality. The opponent is thrown into a tree's opened mouth and soon after the tree begins to feast on the unfortunate soul's flesh, leaving only the legs behind. </p>

                	<p>This arena known as the Lost Bridge, also called Scislac Busorez, consists of a bridge with a large blue-purple portal in the background. This is in fact a combination of the levels Pit II and The Pit III, with the portal being taken from the Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 "Choose Your Destiny" background.
<br /><br />
The unlockable characters, Classic Sub-Zero, Ermac and Mileena are fought in this stage as well as Human Smoke when played as. When all three characters are unlocked, this arena is unlocked in the normal stage reel as the first arena to be loaded in the game.
<br /><br />
This background also reappeared in Mortal Kombat Trilogy. In the N64 version of that game, Blaze and Hornbuckle randomly appear on The Pit II bridge in the background. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>In Ultimate Mortal Kombat, playing as Human Smoke forces the stage reel to use this stage in the next round/match only until the player loses and chooses another character.
The odd name of this arena is actually an anagram of the name "Classic Sub-Zero", referencing the fact that he can be fought and unlocked here. </p>

<br /><br />
The battle begins on a top platform, with large, fiery meteors falling and crashing nearby constantly while kombatants do battle underneath a vile sky. A player can knock their opponent off of the edge of the top platform, sending them crashing through a bridge and finally landing on a lower platform where the fight continues. However, the lower platform is located near jagged rocks with a bridge over top of them, fueling the Pit II rumors. </p>

It was once used to bring warriors from the mainland to Shang Tsung's island fortress for the first Mortal Kombat tournament.
<br /><br />
Now this vessel is mainly used as a cargo ship for Shang Tsung to transport the Dragon King's mummified army from the Lost Tomb to his palace. At times, the cruel sorcerer will then carry prisoners in the ship's cages within the cargo hold, further torturing their souls as they await their executions.

<br /><br />
The ship's main duty is to carry captives and even the mummified remains of the Dragon King's lost army back to Shang Tsung's Palace in Outworld. Prisoners serve the remainder of their lives in slavery, only to surrender their souls to Shang Tsung when they die.

                	<p>The Nexus is a fictional plane of existence in the Mortal Kombat video game series that exists as the central hub between the various realms of existence. The concept was first (and only) introduced in the game Mortal Kombat: Deception, as part of the game's Konquest mode. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>History and Characteristics</b></p>
                    <p>According to the game, the Nexus was created by the Elder Gods to aid their chosen champion in his defense of the realms. The Nexus itself consists of a circular plane bordered by torch pillars that float amongst the clouds in an unknown place. It is rumored that the clouds are meant to suggest that it is located in the Heavens, being it that it was created by the Elder Gods, but such has not been confirmed by Midway Games. Present in the Nexus is an altar to the Elder Gods. Upon it are spaces to place each of the Kamidogu and the Amulet Of Shinnok. The only entrances/exits in the Nexus are a series of six portals, which only open when the appropriate Kamidogu are placed upon the altar. The portal that opens to Earthrealm is available when the Earthrealm Kamidogu is obtained, and when the Earthrealm Kamidogu is placed on the altar, the Netherrealm is revealed. After the Kamidogu from the Netherrealm is obtained and placed on the altar, the Chaosrealm is opened. The Chaosrealm Kamidogu unlocks the Outworld, which in turn will unlock the Orderrealm and Edenia when the appropriate Kamidogu are obtained and placed on the altars. It is said in the game that when all 6 Kamidogu and the Amulet are placed on the altar, the Kamidogu will be transported to the presence of the Elder Gods. Unfortunately, in the video game, once all of the Kamidogu are collected, Onaga appears and steals them, preventing the player from discovering whether or not this is true. Onaga's words suggest that the Kamidogu would not be able to be transported to the Elder Gods unless one had the Amulet of Shinnok, which is not available for collecting during Konquest mode. It is suggested that only the Champion of the Elder Gods would be capable of accessing and utilizing the Nexus for easy transportation between the realms, but this is apparently not the case. As per Deception's storyline, Scorpion is deemed the true champion of the Elder Gods, but Shujinko, Monster, and Onaga all prove capable of entering the Nexus during Konquest mode.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>The Nexus in MK: Deception</b></p>
                    <p>The Nexus is the central hub of travel in the Konquest mode of Mortal Kombat: Deception. After Shujinko obtains the first Kamidogu, Damashi explains to him how to use it to access the portal in Earthrealm and how to get to the Nexus. Once Shujinko is in the Nexus, he places the Earthrealm Kamidogu on the altar, which unlocks the Netherrealm portal. Shujinko then travels sequentially to the Netherrealm, Chaosrealm, Outworld, Orderrealm, and Edenia, unlocking the portal to each level by obtaining the Kamidogu from the previous realm of existence. Once all of the Kamidogu have been collected, Onaga (the Dragon King) appears and steals them, marking the end of the mandatory portion of the quest. From there, Shujinko is still free to walk the realms to do as he sees fit, usually involving the player returning to realms to collect koins and unlockable items.</p>

                    <p>The Nexus is also used in the game as a kombat arena. This occurs twice during the Konquest mode, and also as many times as the player sees fit after he or she unlocks the arena for the versus mode. It is worth noting that when kombat takes place in the Nexus, the altar and portals mysteriously disappear, also the Nexus apears to be smaller then it does in Konquest mode. The arena also has a surprise Death Trap, not expected by anyone prior to the game's release, that allows a player to knock the opponent through the wall surrounding the arena and into the swirling void beyond, never to be seen again. </p>

                    <p><b>Monster</b></p>
                    <p>After obtaining the second Kamidogu from the Netherrealm and placing it on the altar in the Nexus, an unknown character approaches Shujinko, claiming to be the true champion of the Elder Gods. Shujinko naturally takes offense, having been informed by Damashi that he is the real champion, and a fight breaks out between the two characters. Monster (revealed by name only through his life bar during Kombat) is really offense-less, but has the exact same moves as Scorpion, the actual true champion of the Elder Gods. After defeating Monster, Shujinko inquires of Damashi as to who he is, and Damashi responds that he doesn't know.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Scorpion</b></p>
                    <p>After having obtained the sixth Kamidogu, Shujinko returns to the Nexus in an attempt to place the final Kamidogu on the altar. Scorpion then appears in the Nexus, demanding that Shujinko stop interfering in the affairs of the Elder Gods. Shujinko and Scorpion then engage in Mortal Kombat in the final battle of Deception's Konquest Mode. After he is defeated, Scorpion disappears as well, and no further mention of his appearance is made in light of Shujinko turning his attention to the fact that his quest is finally complete. </p>

                    <h4>Palace Grounds:</h4>
                	<p>Premiering and featured in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, this courtyard, the Palace Grounds, was recently built alongside its hidden underground dungeon as part of the architecture of Shang Tsung's Palace, constructed by Li Mei’s people in Outworld under the Deadly Alliance's threat of death. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>Since after the Deadly Alliance took over Outworld, the sorcerer Shang Tsung’s new palace after it was constructed by Li Mei's people under threat of death, is not only the base of operations for the Deadly Alliance, but it also serves as the new location for housing the Dragon King’s mummified army. Though it did not reappear in the sequel, Mortal Kombat: Deception, it is visible in the game's opening cinematic. In it, the camera travels up through between the two giant statues of the Dragon King's mummified dead solders then up the stairs and through the gates, resting at the battle between the Deadly Alliance and Raiden. </p>

                    <h4>Pit I:</h4>
                	<p>The Pit I is an arena in the Mortal Kombat series. The arena debuted in the original Mortal Kombat and later returned in several sequels.
<br /><br />
The Pit lies on Shang Tsung's Island. Combatants fight on a bridge suspended over a sea of steel spikes, which is the source of death for anyone unlucky enough to be knocked off. Shang Tsung had apparently grown frustrated by the number of people who managed to actually survive the spike-laden floor, and thus employed his loyal bodyguard, Reptile to ensure that none walk away alive as he awaits for them at the bottom. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The Pit reappeared in Mortal Kombat Trilogy, but instead of moving clouds, the sky took on different appearances in all versions. The Nintendo 64 version featured a star-filled, pitch black background, and in the CD versions, the sky was identical to that of the Pit II in Mortal Kombat II. The Pit also reappeared in Mortal Kombat: Deception. Few changes were made since its last appearance, although instead of a bridge, the players fight on a square platform. The bridge from the original game can still be seen in the background, however.
<br /><br />
The Pit also appears in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. During the first part of the game, which is very similar to the first Mortal Kombat, the player can go from top of the pit to the bottom without dying, although damage is taken should the character touch the spikes. The first Stage Fatality appeared here, where the victor would uppercut (or in Shaolin Monks, perform a variety of different moves) their opponent off the bridge, who would land on the spikes. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Deception, you fight on a huge square shaped area which is surrounded on all sides by rows upon rows of sharp spikes. There are mountains on all sides of this fighting area as well as two bridges to the left and right of The Pit. These bridges are held up by massive pillars with spikes shooting out of them. The moon is shining brightly in the background, and paying homage to Mortal Kombat 1, there is the shadow of a witch flying past the moon on her broomstick. Once knocked off the platform in which you start, you fall into a bed of very sharp steel spikes. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The Pit makes a comeback once more in Mortal Kombat (2011), though it appears to have been fused with the Pit II as it features lanterns on the bridge as well as a second one parallel to it that features other Kombatants fighting each other. The spikes this time force the liver out of the opponent.
<br /><br />
In all of the games, silhouettes occasionally appear in front of the moon. In Shaolin Monks, the player character will even point them out, and in the original Mortal Kombat, it was necessary for a shadow to be over the moon in order to unlock a battle with Reptile.
<br /><br />
The Pit I is the only Pit-type arena that did not require a specific button combo to execute a Stage Fatality. </p>

                    <h4>Pit II:</h4>
                	<p>The Pit II is the "brother" of the Pit I. Its first appearance was in Mortal Kombat II, and returns for Mortal Kombat Trilogy, Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, and Mortal Kombat (2011). </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>The arena consists of two long bridges parallel of each other very high above the ground. On the other bridge, two kombatants, Blaze and Hornbuckle do kombat (though they only ever remain static). Like its predecessor, the Pit II possesses a stage Fatality. The opponent is knocked off the bridge and falls from a incredibly high altitude where their body is smashed against the hard, flat earth. Unlike the previous Pit incarnation, the player is required to input a unique combination depending on the character.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat Trilogy, the Pit II remains virtually unchanged, but lacks the Stage Fatality, as it would require unique falling sprites for the non-MKII characters.
<br /><br />
In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, the Pit II under its likely original name Frozen Peaks, is the final location of Smoke's quests to unlock Mortal Kombat II and remains visually unchanged. This stage is located in the Living Forest of Outworld in Story Mode, through a portal behind Smoke. The player is required to execute the stage Fatality on multiple opponents by simply uppercutting them off the bridge where their bodies break apart after impacting with the ground. Blaze and Hornbuckle also present in the arena as well, and no longer static as they are actually seen fighting one another.
<br /><br />
In Mortal Kombat (2011), a new 3D design of the Mortal Kombat II arena appears. Instead of static images of Blaze and Hornbuckle, there are actual fights taking place on the far background bridge between random characters from the entire Mortal Kombat game series, including Daegon, who did not appear until Armageddon.
<br /><br />
There is a day and night version, in addition to a Pit apocalyptic-like version with meteors and dark clouds at background. In a rather curious move, the Pit II seems to have been redesigned to become an upgraded version of the original Pit. Instead of the long fall depicted in Mortal Kombat II, there are now enormous spikes lining the bottom. Considering that all arenas shown thus far are exclusively inspired by Mortal Kombat I, II and 3, it is likely that original Pit arena was simply replaced in favor of the Pit II design while keeping the beloved, classic spike impalement finish. </p>
					<p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>The SNES version took advantage of its Mode 7 capability when the Stage Fatality was performed. When the camera switch occurred, the ground would slightly rotate as the loser fell.
    In the Sega Genesis and Amiga version, Hornbuckle's pants are purple and Blaze's are green.
    The Meteor Storm, a new stage in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, was rumored to be a remake of the Pit II, as the bridges of said stage can be seen in the background. Coincidentally enough, there is a meteor shower in the stage's daytime version in Mortal Kombat (2011).
    The Pit II is the only stage in Mortal Kombat Trilogy whose stage fatality was left out of the game. This happened because of the practical impossibility of filming new, extra animations with actors for the non-Mortal Kombat II character sprites for the Pit II's overhead fall.
    In Mortal Kombat Trilogy, its background looks different than in Mortal Kombat II.
    In Mortal Kombat Trilogy by development, its background was the original Mortal Kombat II version, but Hornbuckle and Blaze were left out.
    Much like in the original MK, in Mortal Kombat (2011), it is possible to see the silhouette of Santa Claus flying past on his sleigh, or a witch flying by on a broom. By achieving a Double Flawless victory and performing the Pit Fatality when this happens, Classic Reptile can be fought.
    There are 5 characters seen fighting who are not playable (or to fight in kombat) in MK 2011. These kombatants include Daegon, Reiko, Kenshi (who is now playable as DLC, but with a different design), Sareena and Frost.
    Mortal Kombat II takes place in Outworld, which suggests that the Mortal Kombat II version of the Pit II was also in Outworld. However, this is not the case in Mortal Kombat (2011), since it is redesigned to be like the original Pit on Shang Tsung's Island, which is in Earthrealm.
    On MK 2011, successfully performing an uppercut or special move on this stage will make the volcano shoot up a couple of fireballs. </p>

                    <h4>Pit III:</h4>
                	<p>The Pit III is the third "brother" of the Pit I and Pit II. The Pit III only appears in Mortal Kombat 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, and Mortal Kombat Trilogy; it is the final arena when the player has to confront and fight Shao Kahn the Konqueror.
<br /><br />
This Pit (also called Shao Kahn's Pit) is also Shao Kahn's other secret throne room located inside his fortress. The stage consists of a rather narrow bridge with small spike protruding from its sides. In the background are soul cages containing the captured souls of Earthrealm when Shao Kahn's invasion began, especially the souls of the highest power, such as Earthrealm's leaders as these spirits are protected inside these cages from ever being stolen. On the right end of the arena is Shao Kahn's throne, where the left end is the entrance. Like its predecessors, the Pit III possesses a stage Fatality where the opponent is knocked off the bridge where a row of spinning blades will rip them to shreds. Just like the Pit II, the player again had to input a special button sequence, different for every character. </p>

                    <h4>Pit Bottom:</h4>
                	<p>The Pit Bottom is the bottom of the Pit I and is a selectable arena in Mortal Kombat Trilogy.
Its first appearance was Mortal Kombat when the player has to fight Reptile and then brought back in Mortal Kombat Trilogy. The bottom of The Pit has three bodies of unknown players, four heads impaled in the metal spikes, and one skeleton. They were likely chosen warriors who fought in the tournament of the original game (or from previous tournaments, as the skeleton would indicate) but lost. This arena does not have a stage fatality as the characters are already fighting on the tier.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>This stage reappeared in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks in the first level where it is revealed that it is connected to Goro's Lair. It is also where Liu Kang and Kung Lao battled the Onis and the Oni Warlord before escaping Shang Tsung's island to meet up with Raiden and the others at the Wu Shi Academy.
<br /><br />
The Pit Bottom returns in Mortal Kombat (2011), looking drastically different than other appearances, it has two curving-shaped pillars with spikes that look organic, several spikes surrounding the pillars, and two gargoyles spewing blood out of their mouths. This blood can actually get on your character and stain their clothes, but in the case of Skarlet, she'll likely absorb the blood since she is made from blood. </p>

                    <h4>The Portal:</h4>
                	<p>The Portal is an arena in the Mortal Kombat series. The Portal was introduced in Mortal Kombat II and was later featured in several other games in the series. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Description</b></p>
                    <p>This arena lies within the Highlands of Outworld. The Portal remains still, with the exception of lightning striking in the center. This gateway is very unstable and unpredictable. Shadow Priests stand guard as watchers. Where the portal actually leads to still remains a mystery.
<br /><br />
In the Sega Genesis version of Mortal Kombat II, there was a blue palette-swapped version of the Portal that was used to fight the secret characters Jade, Smoke and Noob Saibot instead of fighting in Goro's Lair.
<br /><br />
The MKII version of the Portal also reappeared in Mortal Kombat Trilogy with an added pagoda-style temple on each end of the arena. The towers from the Hidden Portal can be seen on one side of the arena (now filled with characters from MK1 to MK4 on separate towers if observed closely), with the Portal arena on the other.
<br /><br />
In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, the Portal is the basis of several areas in Outworld (essentially its hub). Each of these areas are generally guarded by two Shadow Priests that must be defeated before the bridge to the portal will appear.
<br /><br />
In Mortal Kombat 3, the Portal reappears again as the stage where one confronts Smoke. It has however, gone under a slight change. It uses the floor from the Pit III and several tournament ladders are strewn across the landscape before the portal.
<br /><br />
In its updated version in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, a light blue version of the arena appears as Scislac Busorez (renamed Lost Bridge in the N64 version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy) where the opponent faces off against secret characters, namely Classic Sub-Zero, for whom the arena is named after, albeit scrambled. The arena is unlocked in the normal arena scroll after the player unlocks all of the secret characters. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Deception, the Portal appears as a combination of its II and 3 incarnations. One side displays the MK3 version (complete with filled ladder spaces using portraits from MK1 to MK4) and the other shows its MKII incarnation. Unlike MKII, five Shadow Priests will watch battles between players there.
<br /><br />
In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, the Portal receives another visual design and is now multi-tiered. The default tier resembles a worn down version of the the Evil Tower whilst the lower one features a portal in the background and is used as a deathtrap. Those unfortunate enough to get knocked into the portal will have their bodies ripped apart and crushed as their pieces are sucked further in, a reference to Raiden having warned Liu Kang and Kung Lao about unstable portals in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. </p>

                	<p>The Portal originally and forever known as the Celestial Portal featured in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance is said to be known only to sorcerers and deities, this ancient waystation is located in Outworld and transports its users to Earthrealm. It is forever watched over by two floating statue heads of old Asian sages. To earn the right to pass, however, one must face and defeat a representation of his or her most powerful adversary. Holding by the four support pillars of the Celestial Portal is a Portal Sphere.
<br /><br />
It can only be accessed by sorcerers and the gods, especially the Elder Gods. The Deadly Alliance used this portal to get to Earthrealm in order to murder Liu Kang, after they apparently killed Shao Kahn, and then with Mavado to get back to Outworld. Raiden then used it to bring his chosen warriors to Outworld to fight the Deadly Alliance. </p>

                	<p>The Prison is a large octagonal cell in the Netherrealm's own Prison of Souls. At the center of the back wall is a large metal fan. The ground is made of cement with a large, square, sewer-like ventilation in the middle, surrounded by four metallic paths leading to the North, South, East, and West ends of the cell. The cell is enclosed by electronic metal doors to either side. This arena made its debut in Mortal Kombat 4 and Mortal Kombat Gold. </p>
                    <p><b>Stage Fatality</b></p>
                    <p>The Prison Stage featured a stage fatality where the player could send the opponent flying into the large metal fan, which proceeded to chop them into bits and pieces and send their head flying towards the screen.﻿</p>

                	<p>The Pyramid of Argus is an ancient structure located and once constructed within a large crater in the Southlands of Edenia. The Pyramid of Argus serves as the final battle with the fire-elemental Blaze. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>Created by the Edenian god Argus as the final battleground and the Elder Gods' safe guard should Armageddon occur, this pyramid rises forth when one of Argus' sons falls in battle. The triumphant son of Argus then steps through a nearby portal, instantly teleporting them to the top of the pyramid to confront the fire elemential Blaze. Downstairs, all Kombatants (possibly fifty to sixty) wage war against one another in an epic conflict of good versus evil and eventually race to the top to gain the power promised should anyone defeat Blaze. Once Blaze is defeated, the vanquisher gains the immense power contained within Blaze, essentially gaining god-like power. Though anyone can obtain this power, Argus meant for only the stronger of his two sons to gain this power and stop Armageddon. Should Blaze emerge victorious, existence itself will end... </p>

                	<p>Introduced in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, Quan Chi's Fortress is the interior of the wicked necromancer Quan Chi’s own home and hidden citadel, and it is located in the Realm of Outworld.
<br /><br />
It features the fighting arena on the right and Quan Chi’s inner sanctum in the "centerfield". The glowing egg in the background is the inner sanctum, a chamber protected by magical runes that covers it, where Quan Chi leaves his body, periodically recharging his power as well as himself astroprojects his consciousness to other planes of existence. The center ring rests above a network of lasers. The lasers make a spider web pattern which is fitting for this evil sorcerer. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Death Trap</b></p>
                    <p>This arena featured a death trap when it returned in Mortal Kombat: Deception, in which it had laser fields below. The lasers make up of a spider web pattern, and when the opponent is knocked off the platform, they free fall until they're sliced to pieces by the lasers. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Concept Art</b></p>
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, there was a concept art based on the exterior of Quan Chi's Fortress, but with another name for the villain's own citadel called "Shoal of Quan Chi" (or "Quan Chi's Shoal"): the evil sorcerer's lair is shown built on a shoal which is sandbar, (or just bar in context), or gravebar is a somewhat linear landform within or extending into a body of water like an island, typically composed of sand, silt or small pebbles. Shoals are characteristically long and narrow (linear) and develop where a stream or ocean current promotes deposition of granular material, resulting in localized shallowing of the water. Shoals like this one, often appears in a lake, in a river, or in a sea. On the Shoal lies a balcony-like road complete with a courtyard, riddled with huge stone heads resembling Quan Chi's face, built around the water and leads directly to the entrance of the fortress where the demon sorcerer Quan Chi resides. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>TV appearance</b></p>
                    <p>The demon sorcerer Quan Chi has another, yet hidden lair called Quan Chi's Palace in Outworld, secretly built and away from prying eyes, and it is first featured in the 9th episode "Quan Chi" of the TV series Mortal Kombat: Conquest and appeared throughout the entire series. It is somewhat a grand yet, sinister-looking, dome-like palace with a yin-yang emblem above its front doors, built inside a mountainside with 5 claw-like rocky pillars over it. Inside his sanctuary is where Quan Chi resides and his beautiful assassins Siann, Sora and Mika report back to him of their findings, successes and even failures. It is where they're usually mistreated by him, even being called miserable sluts when Quan Chi himself becomes displeased and disgusted. </p>

                	<p>Reptile's Lair made its appearance in Mortal Kombat 4, and reappeared in both games Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks and Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>In MK4, Reptile's Lair is a room decorated by scaly reptilian designs. On the center of the back wall is a large reptilian eye with a black vertical slit. There are spherical containers surrounded by snake-like designs at the sides. At the far corners are large stone skulls with wide-open jaws that reveal silhouettes of captive humans chained to the sides of the interiors. This lair belongs to the ninja Raptor Reptile. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Reptile's Lair made its own reappearance as a walkthrough area as well as a fighting arena in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. It's located in a cave within the eerie Living Forest of Outworld. The player must first feed the enemies to the living hungry trees in order to pass through the thorny veins blocked the entrance to the lair. At the heart of this cavernous lair lies a huge chamber where the two Shaolin warriors Liu Kang and Kung Lao, while on a mission to save Earth, battle against Reptile in a dank, watery room beneath the broken floor after defeating his weapon, the Giant Serpent using the stone pillars that holds up the chamber. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>It later reappeared again in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon along with the Giant Serpent, but the beast is only featured as a statue seen in the background of Reptile's Lair. According to unlockable concept art available in the game's Krypt, the Giant Serpent was once intended to be alive in the arena featured as a death trap that would eat any players who were knocked into its mouth. However, the artwork's description states, "the great serpent died before the game was finished and a statue was built in it's (sic) honor." The many giant eggs surrounding the arena are described as being Giant Serpent eggs. Beneath the in-door balcony is the Gem of Tetsurri wrapped in an aura of green energy on a claw-like pedestal. A vibration sound can be heard while near it.</p>

                    <h4>Rooftop:</h4>
                	<p>The Rooftop is an arena in Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat Trilogy and Mortal Kombat (2011). This part of the building is situated somewhere in a city somewhere on Earth. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>This arena is sometimes referred to as The Roof. This is the rooftop of the Bank stage. It also has a better view of the city and Shao Kahn's Fortress. Stone gargoyles line the edge of the building. This place served as the battleground between Sonya Blade and Kano in MK3, the former emerging victorious and the latter plummeting all the way down to the ground. The fact that the Chrysler Building is visible in the background leads to the presumption that the rooftop, and therefore the bank, is in New York City. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat (2011), The Rooftop is complete with a small water tower on it, and has 3 versions: one at daytime during the Outworld invasion, one at nighttime during the invasion, and one after the invasion showcasing the destruction. Shao Kahn's Throne appears in the stage during and after the invasion. The Portal Kahn uses to enter Earthrealm is seen in the nighttime stage. In the daytime stage, military helicopters can be seen battling Outworld's flying monsters and will occasionally strafe the rooftop with machinegun fire (though the players take no damage). </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In the Story Mode, the final battle between Raiden and Shao Kahn takes place on the rooftop at nighttime.</p>
                    <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>The Chrysler Building is featured in the background, so this arena may possibly be based in New York City. In Mortal Kombat (2011), the ad for Johnny Cage's movie, "Ninja Mime", has been replaced by a Jack in the Box ad. The Subway stage and Street stage also have Jack in the box ads. </p>

                    <h4>Shaolin Temple:</h4>
                	<p>The Shaolin Temple or the Shaolin Temples is where the Shaolin monks go to spar with each other and to hone their fighting skills. It is located in China on Earth. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>There are doors that lead into the room with the Mortal Kombat symbols by them; a storm can be seen through the window. And hallways and walls of the temple are filled with skeletons embedded in them. Rooms such as this can also be found in Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero, featuring the Eldest Sub-Zero's adventures before his demise in the first Mortal Kombat at the hands of Scorpion. This was the place where Scorpion was killed in cold blood by the original Sub-Zero, Bi-han.
<br /><br />
The Shaolin Temple has also later reappeared as an arena in Mortal Kombat 4 and Mortal Kombat Gold as well. </p>

                    <h4>Sky Temple:</h4>
                	<p>The Sky Temple was a large tower-like temple located in Earthrealm.
<br /><br />
The Sky Temple, located in Earthrealm, serves as a place of meditation for Raiden. The roof of the Sky Temple is adorned by his War Hammer, which behaves much like a lightning rod. The Sky Temple is 1,666ft tall. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>The Sky Temple is a multi-level tower that premiered in Mortal Kombat: Deception and reappeared in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. Kombatants would start off on the tower's roof, where they had the option of wielding Raiden's War Hammer as an arena weapon. From any side of the roof, a kombatant could push their opponent over the edge and onto a lower balcony. On the lower balcony, were three sides from which a kombatant could again push their opponent—this time, to their deaths as they plunge to the ground far below. Once they hit the ground, they snap to pieces and their head hits the screen, then falls back and squirts blood. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Hidden Messages</b></p>
                    <p>When some characters are pushed into the death trap, they will stop screaming long enough to utter out some last words.
<br /><br />
    "OH MY GOD! THIS IS NOT HAPPENING TO ME!" - said by Jax in Armageddon. Onaga & Blaze also say this line in the same game, although it is not as easy to understand.
    <br /><br />
    "Aww, man, this is gonna suck!" - said by Havik in Deception and Taven in Armageddon.
    "SUCK IT!!" - said by Ermac in both games. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>The Sky Temple was inspired by and in part modeled after the Sears Tower (also known as the Willis Tower.) The Sears/Willis Tower, like the Sky Temple, is 1,666 feet tall and, like Midway Games, is located in Chicago. The arena itself intimidates most fighters as stated above. </p>

                    <h4>Soul Chamber:</h4>
                	<p>The Soul Chamber is a location within Shao Kahn's Fortress in Outworld.
<br /><br />
The Emperor Shao Kahn met with his allies (presumably) in this chamber which was located above the dungeons and below the Balcony arena, but he has already moved his meeting to Shao Kahn's Throne Room atop his fortress. The Soul Chamber pays host to a giant tree. A swirl of kombatants' tormented souls spins within its open mouth as players do battle with each other, under the watch of Shao Kahn's loyal, royal Shadow Priests in the background.
<br /><br />
This arena appears in Mortal Kombat 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat Trilogy, Mortal Kombat Gold and later reappears in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon and Mortal Kombat (2011). </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat (2011), the Soul Chamber returns as the updated version of itself: a cavernous chamber with a strange statue head of a smiling and roaring horned beast with a swirl of screaming tortured souls spinning in its mouth, with somewhat living tentacles on its back and with Shao Kahn's royal Shadow Priests as still, the Soul Chamber's background characters. The Soul Chamber itself is, as confirmed in the game's story, where the warrior Ermac, who was created by Emperor Shao Kahn, begins his rejuvenation process. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>    In Mortal Kombat 3 by development, its background was different a host is red eyes and big green flare.
    The design of the Soul Chamber is somewhat loosely or completely based on the Soul Tombs.
    The Soul Chamber is originally from Mortal Kombat 3; yet in Mortal Kombat (2011)'s Story Mode, it is in the Mortal Kombat II storyline.
    In the first Mortal Kombat film the statue that gave Reptile his ninja body looks very much like the face of the soul chamber statue.
    In the art book from the Kollector's Edition of Mortal Kombat (2011), it states that the stage was in Mortal Kombat 2, when it is actually from Mortal Kombat 3.
    In MK3 a glitch occurs involving this stage. When a player is uppercutted in this stage they are immediately sent to the Balcony. When a fight ends in the balcony the next stage takes place in the Bridge, followed by the Soul Chamber. However, if a fight taking place in the Soul Chamber does not end with an uppercut sending the opponent to the Balcony, the next stage will take place in Shao Kahn's Tower. </p>

                    <h4>Subway:</h4>
                	<p>This regular Subway is like any other subway, it is located and situated deep underneath of any large, urban city on Earth. Featured in Mortal Kombat 3, players fought on one of the tracks, which seemed to be unoccupied throughout the match. The route sign in the stage read BOON/TOBIAS (which were placed there as station names, as seen due to the sign changing to NORTH/SOUTH in Armageddon). As a Stage Fatality, the victim could be uppercutted through the roof and back down to the other side where a passing train speeds into them. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Returning for Mortal Kombat Armageddon, the fight is taken to the platform this time around. The arena receives visual changes such as dimmer lighting and promotional posters of Caged Rage stamped against the walls and a closed off entry, along the the promotional posters of Lt. Sonya Blade as advertisement for the U.S. Special Forces with the motto "We want you". Players can knock one another against cans and benches as well as smash one into the ceiling. The Stage Fatality remains unchanged though now the gore can be seen. Also, now the train runs by from time to time, instead of only appearing when someone is knocked down onto the tracks. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>It reappears in the Mortal Kombat (2011), where it again receives a visual upgrade. A large mural of the Netherrealm Studios logo adorns a wall, as does a Warner Bros. Games logo, an advertisement for Johnny Cage's movie Ninja Mime and a Special Forces poster. The stage fatality receives a re-imagining, also. The victor drags the opponent to the edge of the arena, holding their head in front of a passing train. The collision smashes the windows as it passes, smearing blood across the sides of the carriages as the head drags against the metal. The winner then tosses the loser across the arena to the other tracks, where another train runs the opponent over while the opponent is still airborne. Similar to past games, there is a sign that reads Boon St. and Beran Blvd., which is also seen in The Street. Also in MK 2011´s Story Mode, while still a location in one of Earthrealm's cities, The Subway is (likely) named Boon & Beran Station because it is located near The Street. </p>

                    <h4>Tekunin Prison:</h4>
                    <p>AKA: Tekunin Warship</p>
                	<p>This arena called Tekunin Prison is also part of the "Tekunin Warship" which is built by a clan of cybernectic ninjas known as the Tekunin. This arena is featured in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon and its Konquest mode.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>The Tekunin Prison is a cybernetic room that is used to lock the prisoners inside, located in the Bounty Hunter Warship commanded by the Tekunin clan's Grandmaster, Sektor. It appears in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. The Tekunin Prison appears to be a variation of The Prison arena from Mortal Kombat 4/Mortal Kombat Gold. The fan in the background no longer serves as the death trap as it did in Mortal Kombat 4 /Mortal Kombat Gold, it merely serves as a hazard that damages the players while a larger overhead fan on the ceiling chops the victim sent up there to pieces. There also appears to be a computer console and glass visual screen in the arena that can be destroyed by sending the opponent into them. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Konquest</b></p>
                    <p>In Konquest Mode, the objective is to help the Edenian demigod Taven escape from the Tekunin Warship. It can be achieved by running away from traps, defeating members of the Tekunin clan and defeating their Grandmaster Sektor himself. </p>

                    <h4>Evil Tower</h4> 
                    <p>(redirected from Tower):</p>
                	<p>An ancient and wicked tower-like temple is home to the Shadow Priests, And according to Shaolin Monks, is in Outworld, but is so high up that a blue sky can be seen. It is sometimes referred to simply as "The Tower" or the "Evil Monastery". </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>First appeared as an arena in Mortal Kombat II, then returned as a walkthrough area within Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. This arena has returned in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, renamed the "Evil Tower", featuring a previously unseen area where players can knock their opponents down a nearby flight of stairs to an outdoor section of the arena, featuring a deathtrap portal that players can utilize.
<br /><br />
The Evil Monastery also appears in Mortal Kombat (2011). In this new version, the background constantly shifts between night and day, and the Evil Monastery itself is filled with its golden statues of robed skeletons holding swords across its chambers and even a sundial there. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>    In the first film Mortal Kombat, the Evil Tower itself is also featured as the rocky, yet gothic towering citadel in shape of two connected buildings (first one the tallest, the other one is the second and small) called the Black Tower which is presumably the Emperor's castle or thought to be, however the distinctively-shaped window appears behind the altar of a ruined temple in Outworld where Liu Kang fights Reptile. 
<br /><br />
    The Tower also made its appearance in Liu Kang's flash backs within the episode Skin Deep of the animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm back when inside the tower, he first defeated Shang Tsung and won the battle almost like in the Mortal Kombat movie, save for the fact that Shang Tsung fell on flat floor rather instead of spikes.</p>

                    <h4>Warrior Shrine:</h4>
                	<p>The Warrior Shrine is a shrine dedicated to honor the contestants of the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament, which would have been Shang Tsung's ultimate victory if he had it. Goro's statue is in the center being the Grand Champion. This area is also commonly referred to as "The Hall of Statues". </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>It first appeared in the original Mortal Kombat, located on Shang Tsung's Island, and then again in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, located in the Wu Shi Academy (this newer location may be non-canon, however). In the introduction of Mortal Kombat II, it is revealed that the Warrior Shrine is the area where the final battle between Liu Kang and Shang Tsung took place, as we can see the Shaolin monk delivering his Flying Kick to the sorcerer in this exact location. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The warriors in the shrine are (in order): Scorpion/Sub-Zero, Johnny Cage, Kano, Goro, Liu Kang, Raiden, and Sonya Blade. In Shaolin Monks, a fight with the secret character Ermac will ensue if the player inspects the ninja statue three times, and - in the later discovered Endurance mode - the shrine is also where the player fights all four ninja characters (Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Ermac, and Reptile). In this battle, the statues can be destroyed for a medium health full. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>Along with Palace Gates, The Warrior Shrine is the only stage from the original MK that didn't return in MK 2011, instead being replaced by Shang Tsung's Garden.
    In the first game, there is a statue of a ninja which is of Scorpion's since he kills Sub-Zero in the game. </p>

                    <h4>Wastelands of Outworld:</h4>
                    <p>Redirected from Wastelands</p>
                	<p>This brutal and nightmarish area known as Wastelands (also in full, the Wastelands of Outworld) was a regional part of the Realm of Outworld. This location was a bleak and ruined landscape which was forever dominated by the night. The roadsides served as a battlefield which provoked a feeling of spontaneous conflict. A catapult resided nearby which was the source of many Fatalities. There are a couple areas in Outworld such as the Falling cliffs, the sea of blood and more.
<br /><br />
This arena made its debut in Mortal Kombat II and returned in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, where players meet - and rescue - a maskless Kabal and cross the Wastelands' gigantic, bloody lake called the Sea of Blood in order to progress further into the wastelands. This arena returned as a stone fortress within the wasteland at war with another nearby tower in Mortal Kombat Armageddon. The players start within the fortress' main gates, although the opponent can be knocked through the gate down to the courtyard below, which contains five burning catapults being used in the battle, which also work as deathtraps - there is one more catapult within the gates, as well.
<br /><br />
This is what's left of Edenia, a once beautiful realm ruled by King Jerrod and Queen Sindel. After Shao Kahn's warriors defeated Edenia's warriors in ten consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments, the Konqueror was free to invade Edenia and convert the realm as part of Outworld that is still under his brutal rule. This brutal, nightmarish area became what is known as the Wastelands.
<br /><br />
In Mortal Kombat (2011), the Wastelands are fought along a shoreline this time around displaying burning destruction and also old netherships on sea in the background. There appears to be several corpses of all shapes and sizes washed up along the shore. </p>
					<p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                    <p>The Wastelands appear as part of Outworld in the first Mortal Kombat movie. It is there that Liu Kang fights Reptile.<br />
    Originally, artist Tony Goskie had added a crucified, four-armed Shokan into the background of the Wastelands in Mortal Kombat II. However, the company was afraid it was going to be perceived as sacrilegious, so it had to be removed.<br />
    It is said that the big building across the water on MKII and trilogy is Kahn's Arena. </p>

                    <h4>Wu Shi Academy:</h4>
                	<p>The Wu Shi Academy is a location in Earthrealm within the Mortal Kombat video games. The lei tai center platform is suspended by five massive statues of great masters that founded the academy. The center practice area is used to evaluate tests as the teachers watch from the tower.
<br /><br />
It first appeared by that name in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, as the place where Liu Kang and the Shaolin monks were training when Kang was killed by Shang Tsung, disguised as Kung Lao and assisted by Quan Chi. It is also the place where Bo' Rai Cho trains Earth's warriors like Liu Kang and Kung Lao. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Johnny Cage, and Sonya Blade escape to the Wu Shi Academy through a portal on Shang Tsung's island. This is also where the heroes of come to as a haven. There they were honored by Raiden and the Shaolin monks before the academy is attacked by Tarkatan warriors. The Warrior Shrine from the first Mortal Kombat game is on the grounds of the Wu Shi Academy, and the mysterious warrior Ermac lurks there waiting for a challenger. The Wu Shi's Academy's lei tai platform also appeared as an arena within the VS mode of Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks under the name Wu Shi Arena.
<br /><br />
The Wu Shi Academy also made an appearance in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe and Mortal Kombat (2011), after Liu Kang defeats Shang Tsung, though, it is the only time it could be seen. </p>
