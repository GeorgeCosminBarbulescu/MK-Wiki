                    <br />
            		<p>Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, known as Mortal Kombat: The Animated Series outside of the U.S., is a cartoon series based on the popular Mortal Kombat video game series (mainly <a class="custom" href="MK3.html" title="Mortal Kombat 3"> Mortal Kombat 3 </a> and its expansions, with some elements of <a class="custom" href="MK2.html" title="Mortal Kombat 2"> Mortal Kombat II </a>). Produced by <a class="custom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_Entertainment" title="Threshold Entertainment"> Threshold Entertainment </a> (who worked on both movies) and Film Roman, it aired on the <a class="custom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network" title="Threshold Entertainment"> USA Network </a>'s <a class="custom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Cartoon_Express" title="Threshold Entertainment"> Action Extreme Team </a> animation block for one season of 13 episodes from September to December 1996, back-to-back with those of the Street Fighter animated series.
<br /><br />
The show serves as an alternative sequel to the first Mortal Kombat film and takes a Saturday morning cartoon-style approach to the Mortal Kombat franchise, including the toning down of the violence.</p>
			<br />
		<hr id="hline" />
        	<h2>Story</h2>
            	<p>The show was focused on a group of warriors assembled by <a class="custom" href="MK9Raiden.html" title="Mortal Kombat Raiden - The God of Thunder"> Raiden </a> ( <a class="custom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clancy_Brown" title="Clancy Brown"> Clancy Brown </a>) to defend Earthrealm from invaders who entered through portals from various other dimensions. The assembled warriors included <a class="custom" href="MK9LiuKang.html" title="Mortal Kombat Liu Kang"> Liu Kang </a> ( <a class="custom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tochi" title="Brian Tochi"> Brian Tochi </a> ), <a class="custom" href="MK9Stryker.html" title="Mortal Kombat Curtis Stryker"> Stryker </a> ( <a class="custom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Perlman" title="Ron Perlman"> Ron Perlman </a>), <a class="custom" href="MK9Sonya.html" title="Mortal Kombat Sonya Blade"> Sonya Blade </a> ( <a class="custom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_d%27Abo" title="Olivia d'Abo">Olivia d'Abo </a>), <a class="custom" href="MK9Jax.html" title="Mortal Kombat Jax"> Jax </a> ( <a class="custom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_Harewood" title="Dorian Harewood"> Dorian Harewood </a>), <a class="custom" href="MK9Kitana.html" title="Mortal Kombat Kitana"> Kitana </a> ( <a class="custom" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838588/" title="Cree Summer"> Cree Summer </a>), and <a class="custom" href="MK9SubZero.html" title="Mortal Kombat Sub-Zero"> Sub-Zero ( <a class="custom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Perry" title="Luke Perry"> Luke Perry </a>), with <a class="custom" href="MK9Nightwolf.html" title="Mortal Kombat Nightwolf"> Nightwolf </a> ( <a class="custom" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0857184/" title="Tod Thawley"> Tod Thawley </a>) functioning mostly as tech support but still entering the fray on various occasions. The warriors operated out of a hidden base from where Nightwolf and Raiden monitored portal openings; the warriors would fly dragon-shaped jets to deal with disturbances. <a class="custom" href="MK9ShaoKahn.html" title="Mortal Kombat Shao Kahn"> Shao Kahn </a> was something of an arch-villain throughout the series, being responsible for allowing other realms to invade Earthrealm, but <a class="custom" href="MK9KungLao.html" title="Mortal Kombat Kung Lao"> Kung Lao </a>, <a class="custom" href="MK9JohnnyCage.html" title="Mortal Kombat Johnny Cage"> Johnny Cage </a>, <a class="custom" href="MK9Mileena.html" title="Mortal Kombat Mileena"> Mileena </a>, <a class="custom" href="MK9Sindel.html" title="Mortal Kombat Sindel"> Sindel </a>, <a class="custom" href="MK9Jade.html" title="Mortal Kombat Jade"> Jade </a>, <a class="custom" href="MK9NoobSaibot.html" title="Mortal Kombat Noob Saibot"> Noob Saibot </a>, <a class="custom" href="MK9Goro.html" title="Mortal Kombat Goro"> Goro </a> and <a class="custom" href="MK9Kintaro.html" title="Mortal Kombat Kintaro"> Kintaro </a> were not shown or referenced in the show at all. The finale involved Kitana leading a rebellion from Outworld against Kahn.
<br /><br />
The characters and their backgrounds were mostly continuous with the movie, although elements of Mortal Kombat 3 were included. The episode plots themselves shared little relation with that of any of the games, though the character designs are based on their Mortal Kombat 3 and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 sprites (except for Kitana, whose design looks like a blend of her MKII and her UMK3 looks), with some liberties were taken with some characters' designs. Perhaps the most notable aspect of the show was that it provided the debut of Quan Chi, the villain of Mortal Kombat 4 and Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance.</p>

        	<h2>Episodes</h2>
            	<h4><a class="custom" title="Episode 1: Kombat Begins Again" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTw4ugmkSyA"> Episode 1: "Kombat Begins Again" </a></h4>
                	<p>The Defenders of the Realm face a pack of invading cybernetic units (seemingly Shao Kahn's basic footsoldiers) led by <a class="custom" title="MK Sektor" href="MK9Sektor.html"> Sektor </a> and <a class="custom" title="MK Cyrax" href="MK9Cyrax.html"> Cyrax </a>. The situation takes a turn for the worse until Sub-Zero intervenes and assists the warriors in forcing the invaders back to Outworld. Sub-Zero tries to warn the warriors of the incoming threat from Scorpion, although Sonya Blade is hesitant to believe him due to the fact he betrayed his clan. Following Raiden's instructions, the warriors relunctanty return to base with Sub-Zero in company. Shortly afterwards, a group of Nomad warriors locate and invade the base, further raising Sonya's belief that Sub-Zero has betrayed them. After staving off the Nomad invaders outside, Sub-Zero and Nightwolf fight off the ones inside, with Sub-Zero defeating their leader, Karbrac. Sonya is finally convinced that the runaway Lin Kuei is on their side. Before apologies can be made, an alarm sounds, indicating Scorpion's approach.
<br /><br />
Despite the games' graphic nature, DotR was aimed at a younger audience and thus contained toned-down violence. During a recreated flashback of Liu Kang's fight scene with Sub-Zero from the movie, Sub-Zero is merely frozen by the water thrown by Liu Kang, whereas in the film he was impaled by a water-turned-to-ice stake. Although <a class="custom" title="MK Baraka" href="MK9Baraka.html"> Baraka </a> makes no appearance in the series, the Nomad leader in this episode is named Karbrac; this was likely intended as a phonetic anagram of Baraka's name. His race was also referred to as the Nomads throughout the series, as they were not renamed as Tarkatan until well after the show's run.

                	<p>Continuing from the last episode, the team soon discover that a rift has opened up in an ancient burial ground in the Tibetan mountains. Drawing on the powers of darkness, Scorpion, an undead warrior who was denied entrance to the realm of honored dead and banished to the realm of lost souls, has amassed a force of undead warriors and seeks to continue increasing his force with undead warriors from all the realms. The warriors follow <a class="custom" title="MK Scorpion" href="MK9Scorpion.html"> Scorpion </a> to Outworld and find themselves in danger of alerting Shao Kahn to their presence. Eventually, the earth warriors find themselves in a tomb built for Outworld's most evil of warriors. It is also the resting place of the sorcerer Shang Tsung. Sub-Zero charges after Scorpion, who reveals his intention to resurrect Shang Tsung. Sub-Zero's anger gets the better of him, though, and he is quickly subdued. Sub-Zero entrusts Liu Kang with the task of defeat Scorpion because he believes that he could've defeated his brother without the help Kitana gave him. Liu Kang defeats Scorpion in Mortal Kombat with help from Sub-Zero. Sub-Zero almost throws Scorpion from the top of Shang Tsung's tomb until Liu reminds him that, without honor, he would be no better than his brother. Along with his undead soldiers, Scorpion is sent back to the realm of lost souls. Just when the earth warriors think that their work is done, Nightwolf contacts Liu Kang to inform him that another rift has been found.

"Sting of the Scorpion" featured music by Psykosonik and Sister Machine Gun in addition to the regular score composed by Jonathan Sloate.

Jax's cybernetic implants are damaged by Komodai's acid, causing the loss of important microchips, without which his arms cannot function properly.

Smoke's orders are to annihilate Sub-Zero and he nearly succeeds, until he suddenly realizes that he has retained his soul, and fights alongside his friend Sub-Zero once again. They team up to drive Oniro away, and though Smoke will not befriend Sub-Zero again since the latter is an enemy of the Lin Kuei, he honors their past oath to never fight each other in combat, and then disappears.

Nightwolf gets very worried after leading his fellow warriors to temporary rips around the world that close before they arrive, but takes umbrage with the warriors deeming all of these incidents as incorrect readings of his computers. Encouraged by Raiden to not be so overreliant on technology, he uses his magic force to find out where the Black Dragons are; it turns out their shelter is hidden under an Egyptian pyramid. When the Earth Warriors arrive, they encounter and defeat its guardians. Then the struggle with Kano begins, who had already lost an earlier fight with Sonya in the first Mortal Kombat tournament and loses this fight as well. Kano tells them that the pyramid is rigged with explosives, but the Earth Warriors escape the pyramid just in time to escape the explosion.
<br /><br />
This episode featured the debut of the newly revised Kano. His nationality was changed from American to Australian as a tribute to actor Trevor Goddard's performance in the first MK movie, and his fight with Sonya therein was briefly seen in flashback midway through the episode. However, in a continuity violation, he is beforehand seen bald and in his MK3 outfit during a scene in which Sonya's Special Forces partner, Wexler (named after Threshold writer/producer Josh Wexler), was killed prior to the tournament.

Shang Tsung is the most suitable person to possess the sphere, because the more malicious the master is, the stronger the magic sphere becomes. The old enemy of good organizes different natural disasters and weakens Raiden. The Earth Warriors are trapped, so nobody can help the God of Thunder. Thus, he is the one who has to decide the fate of the world. But good, even though it grew weak, is stronger than the evil even when strengthened with the forces of magic. Having defeated Shang Tsung, Raiden gets rid of the sphere by sending it into space.
<br /><br />
At the end of this episode, a mysterious figure runs into the portal to follow the sphere - the identity of this person is never fully revealed, but is explained in other animated programs that were shown on the USA Network in tandem with Mortal Kombat, namely Savage Dragon, Street Fighter and Wing Commander Academy. This episode was the third part of a crossover in which the man who runs through the portal after the sphere, has been following it from their own separate universe to keep it out of the wrong hands. In each of the shows, the sphere has slightly different powers and effects.

Sonya is wounded, but rescued by a former member of the Black Dragon - <a class="custom" title="MK Kabal" href="MK9Kabal.html"> Kabal </a>. Years ago, he was one of the best warriors in his clan, but Shao Kahn, fearing Kabal's possible conversion to the side of good, therefore ordered his warriors to destroy him. By a miracle, Kabal survived in his fight with the hired killers, but his face was viciously scarred, and he was forced thereafter to rely on a respirator while concealing his face behind a mask. Kano and his servants open a portal to lead the army of evil to other worlds. With the help of Kabal, the Earth Warriors manage to crush these forces unleashed by Kano and destroy the portal. The Earth Warriors offer Kabal the chance to join them, but he chooses to continue his crusade against evil alone. Sonya is notably moved by Kabal's story and is upset when he leaves.
<br /><br />
One rerun of "Amends" aired during the fifth annual UNICEF International Children's Day of Broadcasting.[1] The story of Kabal almost exactly follows his MK3 story, where he's portrayed as a protagonist minus the subplot of Kano's betrayal.

They anxiously await the confrontation, but Liu Kang shows more apprehension because a victory would mean that Kitana would have to leave the team to rule Edenia. Kitana brokers an agreement with Sheeva's Shokan warriors, but she doesn't know that she is in fact Shang Tsung, who transformed to look like Sheeva. Kitana and the rebellion forces break into Shao Kahn's castle and demand that Shao Kahn hands over his rule to the princess. Suddenly Shang Tsung appears with the warriors of the real Sheeva. The sorcerer is also after the throne of Outworld. But Tsung forgets one thing; Sheeva and the Shokan also have enemies in Outworld. Raiden finds out Shang Tsung's plan and disrupts the fight. The god of thunder brings with him the worst enemy of Sheeva; Motaro, and the whole Centaur and Tarkatan army. The defenders escape through a portal as the Shokan and Centaurs do battle. The insurrection may have failed, but the realm of Earth has not fallen and Mortal Kombat continues. It is unknown what happens next as the series ends.
