            	<p>Mortal Kombat III was the third game in the Mortal Kombat series, improving the gameplay and expanding the mythos of his previous two MK's, notably introducing multiple and varied Fatalities, Animalities and several iconic characters, such as Smoke, Striker, Shao Kahn's new extermination squad leader Motaro and some others. The game's plot continues on from the second part, featuring the next Mortal Kombat tournament being set in the Earthrealm which now is invaded because it has a connection with Outworld. The game was later updated to <a class="custom" href="MK3Ultimate.html">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a> and then later on, to <a class="custom" href="MKTrilogy.html">Mortal Kombat Trilogy</a></p>
            <hr id="hline" style="margin-top:15px;" />
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            	<img class="right" src="Imagini/MK3/mk3ss.png" width="300" height="779" title="MK3 screen shots" alt="no image loaded" />
                <iframe class="right" width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pUgWaXPxsV8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Mortal Kombat 3 builds further on the gameplay of the previous game. A &quot;Run&quot; button, accompanied by a &quot;Run&quot; meter, was introduced. This was primarily to address concern from fans who thought that the previous games gave too much of an advantage to the defending player. The Run meter is drained by running (the character cannot run backwards, only forwards) and by performing combos.The gameplay system of Mortal Kombat II is an improved version of that from the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick were added, low and high kicks became differentiated (be it crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick was made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, similarity to the game's uppercut), and it is easier to perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some in-air, and the game plays almost twice as fast as the original. However, all characters in the game still share generic attributes (such as speed, power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.</p><br />

<p>&quot;Chain combos&quot;, also known as pre-programmed combos (labeled &quot;dial-a-combos&quot;) were also introduced. Chain combos are preprogrammed button presses that cannot be interrupted once one hit connects. Some chain combos end with an uppercut or other move that knocks the opponent into the air, so that more punishment can be dealt via a traditional juggle combo. To please players of various skill levels, a &quot;Choose Your Destiny&quot; screen appears in the single player mode. This new feature allowed player-selectable difficulty.
</p><br />

<p>For the first time, certain levels were interactive by allowing characters to be uppercutted through the ceiling where both characters would continue the battle in a different stage. This could alter the game's level cycle. Both normal uppercuts and uppercuts that are part of a ground combo would result in a level change. Kung Lao's &quot;Whirl Wind Spin&quot; move would also have the same effect. However, if the final hit of a round happens to be an uppercut (i.e., the character is defeated by an uppercut), there is no level change.</p><br />

<p>All of the different style of finishing moves featured in Mortal Kombat II (Fatalities, including their non-lethal Babality and Friendship version) return in MK3 but this time the announcer saying &quot;Friendship! Friendship?!&quot; was changed to &quot;Friendship! Friendship?! Again?!&quot;. Additionally, the long rumored Animality, where the character transforms into an animal in order to kill their opponent, is featured for the first time. Another new addition is the Mercy, where the character can give their opponent a small sliver of life if they have won two rounds and are at the &quot;Finish Him/Her&quot; screen. It is necessary that a Mercy is performed for an Animality to occur. Finally, three new stage Fatalities can be performed in the Subway, the Bell Tower and the Pit 3.</p><br />

<p>Another concept introduced in this game are the &quot;Kombat Kodes&quot;. These were 6-symbol codes entered at the VS screen in a two player game, to modify gameplay, fight hidden characters or display certain text messages. Also introduced in this game was the &quot;Ultimate Kombat Kode&quot;, using a 10 character code using symbols, that could be entered after the continue screen disappears in single player mode. If the correct code was entered, an animation would be shown flashing the kombat zones in quick succession and Smoke would become a permanent playable character. The arcade owner, however, could reset this code by accessing the game's diagnostic menu by toggling a DIP switch within the MK3 cabinet. Smoke can be unlocked by either the player or the arcade operator.</p><br />

<p>The game's overall style was envisioned differently than in the previous Mortal Kombat games. Opposed to the heavily Oriental themes of Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II, MK3's theme is much more Western contemporary. The game's stages are set in modern locations, three of the characters are cyborgs, and traditional character designs (such as Sub-Zero's or Kano's) have been dropped or modified in favor of modern replacements. The overall game has a much darker tone than its predecessors, and uses a noticeable darker and less vibrant color palette. Characters were heavily digitized, as opposed to the hybrid digitized/hand-drawn style of MKII. Many of the game's backgrounds were, for the first time, created using pre-rendered 3D graphics. This change is also reflected in the sound track, in which all Oriental motifs have been dropped in favor of modern instrumentation.</p><br /><br />

            <h2>Storyline</h2>
            <p>Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen. When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld. Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.</p><br />
            <h4>Sub Plots</h4>
            	<p>Having defeated Shao Kahn in Outworld, Liu Kang now finds himself as the prime target of Shao Kahn's elimination squads. In response to the upcoming threat, he aligns himself with Kung Lao and leads the rebellion against Shao Kahn and his Outworld minions. However, he also has an ulterior motive: he seeks to defeat Kahn and free Kitana's homeland of Edenia.</p><br />
                <p>With the latest advancements in human technologies, the Lin Kuei decide to automate their human assassins into soulless machines. Four ninjas- Cyrax, Sektor, Smoke and Sub-Zero- are selected to serve as the first automation prototypes, but Sub-Zero and Smoke refuse to participate- leading to their leaving of the clan. Unfortunately, Smoke is captured and is automated along with Sektor and Cyrax and all three are programmed to hunt down and eliminate Sub-Zero. Meanwhile, learning of the upcoming Outworld threat, Sub-Zero joins the rebellion against Shao Kahn.</p><br />
                <p>Jax discovers the location of both Sonya and Kano while in Outworld, and in freeing Sonya, he also frees Kano. Knowing that his near future means arrest, Kano uses this opportunity to escape into the depths of Outworld and ultimately joins Shao Kahn's forces. Sonya and Jax return to Earth and try to warn their government about the upcoming Outworld threat- but when their pleas are ignored, Sonya and Jax instead prepare themselves for the upcoming war by joining the rebellion.</p><br />
                <p>Despite both serving Shao Kahn, the Centaurs and Shokans have been at war with each other for years. Suspicions arise when Sheeva, who is appointed Sindel's bodyguard, learns that Motaro is appointed as Kahn's General in his armies. With the apparent, yet unconfirmed, "deaths" of both Kintaro and Goro, Sheeva begins to fear for her own race, and makes plans to turn against Kahn should her suspicions prove to be true.</p><br />
                <p>Largely dependent on a respirator and an undying thirst for revenge against the Black Dragon clan (who he believes was responsible for his brutal attack), Kabal joins the rebellion upon learning of Kano's survival.</p><br />
                <p>Though he realizes that he is the lone survivor of New York City following the Outworld Invasion, Stryker remains ignorant as to why he survived the attack. However, upon receiving a vision from Raiden and being informed of what has transpired, Stryker decides to find and join the other Earthrealm Warriors.</p><br />
                <p>For many years, Nightwolf received visions that foretold and warned him of the upcoming invasion. Largely ignoring them, he feels guilty for not preventing it, and therefore offers to join the upcoming rebellion.</p><br />
                <p>Johnny Cage was hunted down by one of Shao Kahn's extermination squads, and during the vicious battle that followed, he was killed, allegedly by Motaro.</p><br />
