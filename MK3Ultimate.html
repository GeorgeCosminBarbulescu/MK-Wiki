            	<p>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (UMK3) is a fighting game in the Mortal Kombat series, released to arcades in 1995. It is an update of Mortal Kombat 3, featuring tweaked gameplay, additional characters and new in-game environments. Various home versions of the game were released soon after the arcade original, although none were completely identical to the arcade version. More recent home versions emulated the arcade original with more accuracy, including Mortal Kombat Kollection, which included the game alongside its predecessors Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat.
                <br /> 
                The game was well received and has been considered a high point for the Mortal Kombat series. In 2008, Ed Boon stated that this game is his favorite 2D Mortal Kombat title.
                <br /> 
                Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later updated to include content from previous games in the series as part of the console exclusive Mortal Kombat Trilogy.</p>
                <br />
            <hr id="hline" />
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            	<img class="right" src="Imagini/MK3 Ultimate/mk3uss.png" width="300" height="779" title="MK3U screen shots" alt="no image loaded" />
                <iframe class="right" width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6uoU0vZ1cP8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Gameplay was identical to MK3 but introduced a few new elements. New MK3 characters were added in UMK3, including Kitana, Jade, Reptile and Scorpion on the prototype version; new Ultimate Kombat Code added in revision 1.0 to enable Mileena, Ermac and Classic Sub-Zero. Two new gameplay modes were introduced: the 2-on-2 Mode which was similar to an Endurance match but with human players on both sides, and a new eight-player Tournament Mode.
                <br />
Some characters were given new moves and some character moves were altered a bit, in most cases to balance the gameplay. Some characters were given extra combos and some combos were even damage reduced. Chain combos could be started by using a jump punch (vertical or angled) or a vertical jump kick, which created more comboing opportunities. Combos that knock opponents in the air would no longer send one's opponent to the level above in multi layered levels (only regular uppercuts would be allowed for this).
				<br />
Additionally several miscellaneous features were added and changed to UMK3. The original red portal background used for the "Choose Your Destiny" screen is now replaced with Blue Portal and an extra Master difficulty is added as well. In the additional "Master" difficulty setting, Endurance Matches return, in which the player can face as many as three opponents in a given round. These were not seen since the first Mortal Kombat. Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures - selectable prizes, some are extra fights, others lead to various cutscenes or other things - are introduced after either the main game or the 8-player tournament are completed. The smallest alterations to the game include character announcements when Shang Tsung transforms and the "Toasty!" sound is now played during the game's end credits and when the players inserting a coin, when Dan Forden's image is shown.
				<br />
Some elements from MK3 were missing in UMK3. The only biographies featured are Kitana, Jade, Scorpion, and Reptile, which is only all four available during attract mode, the ninja characters who were not included in MK3, but were added to the lineup for this release, while all of the biographies and the full-body portraits of the MK3 characters are missing. The biographies that are featured use their Versus screen portrait, with text, on the portal/battleplan background. All of the character endings show each character's versus screen picture accompanied by text, instead of using original art as MK3 did. The storyline intro pictures and accompanying text are never shown. Finally, The Bank and Hidden Portal were the only stages missing from UMK3. They were removed completely from gameplay.
				<br />
The CPU AI was improved in the game. However, three new flaws were introduced along with the revisions: while backflipping away from an opponent, if the player performs a jump kick, the CPU will always throw a projectile. This leaves the CPU vulnerable to attacks such as Sektor's teleport-uppercut, which can easily lead into a devastating combo. If the player walks back-and-forth within a certain range of the AI's chosen character, the CPU will mimic the player's walking movements for the whole round and never attack (this gameplay flaw remained and was not corrected for Mortal Kombat Trilogy). Also, if the AI was cornered, the player could repeatedly perform punches without the AI stumbling back, thus creating an opportunity to get a free win. In addition, an earlier version of the AI was used in UMK3—version 1.1 of the AI was used instead of version 1.2, which caused issues with its less-developed code.</p>

            <h2>Storyline</h2>
            <p>Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen. When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld. Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.</p><br />
            <h4>Sub Plots</h4>
            	<p>Having defeated Shao Kahn in Outworld, Liu Kang now finds himself as the prime target of Shao Kahn's elimination squads. In response to the upcoming threat, he aligns himself with Kung Lao and leads the rebellion against Shao Kahn and his Outworld minions. However, he also has an ulterior motive: he seeks to defeat Kahn and free Kitana's homeland of Edenia.</p><br />
                <p>With the latest advancements in human technologies, the Lin Kuei decide to automate their human assassins into soulless machines. Four ninjas- Cyrax, Sektor, Smoke and Sub-Zero- are selected to serve as the first automation prototypes, but Sub-Zero and Smoke refuse to participate- leading to their leaving of the clan. Unfortunately, Smoke is captured and is automated along with Sektor and Cyrax and all three are programmed to hunt down and eliminate Sub-Zero. Meanwhile, learning of the upcoming Outworld threat, Sub-Zero joins the rebellion against Shao Kahn.</p><br />
                <p>Jax discovers the location of both Sonya and Kano while in Outworld, and in freeing Sonya, he also frees Kano. Knowing that his near future means arrest, Kano uses this opportunity to escape into the depths of Outworld and ultimately joins Shao Kahn's forces. Sonya and Jax return to Earth and try to warn their government about the upcoming Outworld threat- but when their pleas are ignored, Sonya and Jax instead prepare themselves for the upcoming war by joining the rebellion.</p><br />
                <p>Despite both serving Shao Kahn, the Centaurs and Shokans have been at war with each other for years. Suspicions arise when Sheeva, who is appointed Sindel's bodyguard, learns that Motaro is appointed as Kahn's General in his armies. With the apparent, yet unconfirmed, "deaths" of both Kintaro and Goro, Sheeva begins to fear for her own race, and makes plans to turn against Kahn should her suspicions prove to be true.</p><br />
                <p>Largely dependent on a respirator and an undying thirst for revenge against the Black Dragon clan (who he believes was responsible for his brutal attack), Kabal joins the rebellion upon learning of Kano's survival.</p><br />
                <p>Though he realizes that he is the lone survivor of New York City following the Outworld Invasion, Stryker remains ignorant as to why he survived the attack. However, upon receiving a vision from Raiden and being informed of what has transpired, Stryker decides to find and join the other Earthrealm Warriors.</p><br />
                <p>For many years, Nightwolf received visions that foretold and warned him of the upcoming invasion. Largely ignoring them, he feels guilty for not preventing it, and therefore offers to join the upcoming rebellion.</p><br />
